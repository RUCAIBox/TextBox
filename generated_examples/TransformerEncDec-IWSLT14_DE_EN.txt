you know , one of the great < unk > about travel , and one of the pleasure in the < unk > research is to live with people who remember the old days , and they still remember the wind in the wind , but they & apos ; re touching the < unk > .
just knowing that < unk > is still going beyond the milky way galaxy , or the importance of the myths that matter most , or that in the himalayas , the way we & apos ; re looking at the breath , is not the very important thing that we & apos ; re talking about in the need to put a memory of anthropology in the world .
and of course we are all sharing the same < unk > .
we are all born . we bring kids to the world .
we & apos ; re going through < unk > .
we have to deal with the < unk > separation of death , and so we don & apos ; t have to be surprised that we & apos ; re all singing , dancing and creating art .
but interesting is the unique tone of the dna , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn & apos ; t matter if it & apos ; s the < unk > in the woods of learning , or the < unk > in haiti , or the warriors in the < unk > & apos ; s < unk > , the < unk > desert in the sahara , or in the sahara < unk > .
all these people teach us that there are other < unk > , other ways of thinking , other ways of trying to think about the earth .
and that & apos ; s an idea that , if you think about it , can only be familiar with hope .
together , the < unk > cultures of the world are < unk > and < unk > life that < unk > the earth , and perhaps critical to the earth as important as the biological < unk > that you know as biosphere .
you can think of this cultural < unk > as a < unk > . < unk > can be defined as the number of ideas and dreams , myths , < unk > and < unk > that have been defined by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the < unk > is the great legacy of humanity .
it & apos ; s the symbol of all the things we are and what we can do as an amazing species .
and just like the biosphere got strong , this happened with the < unk > -- except for even bigger speed .
biologist , for example , would argue that 50 percent or more of all species in a row than extinction because it & apos ; s simply not true , and yet , this -- the < unk > < unk > < unk > in the field of biological diversity -- which doesn & apos ; t make us worse than the car .
and the < unk > < unk > for that is extinction of languages .
when each of you were born in this room , it was spoken on the earth for 6,000 languages .
now it & apos ; s not just a language of the total , or a series of < unk > .
one is expression of the human mind .
it & apos ; s a means by which the soul of a certain culture can access to the physical world .
each language is like the forest of mind , an inflection forest , a turning point , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6,000 languages today , while we & apos ; re sitting in monterey , the very half will not fall into children & apos ; s ears anymore .
you & apos ; re not taught anymore . that means if nothing is tried , you & apos ; re actually dead .
what might be more than being the silence of the last one of the last people in your language to speak to you , have no way to pass the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect the children ?
and yet , this horrible destiny actually < unk > someone on the earth about two weeks , because every two weeks , an older person dies and takes the last < unk > of an old language that comes into the grave .
and i know some of you will say , & quot ; isn & apos ; t it better ? & quot ; wouldn & apos ; t the world be a better place if we all talk a language ? & quot ; and i say , & quot ; well , let & apos ; s show this talk .
let & apos ; s go with them . & quot ;
and then suddenly you would realize how it would be if you couldn & apos ; t speak your own language .
so today , i & apos ; d like to take you on a journey through the production journey , a short journey through the design journey , to try to get them to understand what & apos ; s actually lost .
now there are some of us who are in a certain way that , when i say , & quot ; different ways of being , & quot ; really different ways of being mine .
take , for example , this child of the < unk > in the amazon forest , the people of the amazon forest , believe that they & apos ; re < unk > out the middle east & apos ; s < unk > by sacred snakes .
this is a society that & apos ; s not cognitively different between the color blue and the green , because it & apos ; s the forest that people depend on , is < unk > .
they have a strange language and a < unk > called the linguistic < unk > , which means you need to marry somebody who & apos ; s talking to another language .
and all this is in the < unk > past , and the curious thing about these big houses , where , if you have six or seven languages , you & apos ; re talking about , you & apos ; re never going to hear somebody who & apos ; s learning language .
they only listening and then start talking .
or one of the most fascinating tribes that i & apos ; ve ever lived with , the < unk > in the northeast of ecuador , an astonishing people to be contacted peaceful first year .
so in 1957 , five < unk > were trying to < unk > and make a < unk > mistake .
they < unk > photos of moving air , which we would grade as kind of friendly act , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest had never seen before in their life .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face or to see the character , found nothing to suggest that this was business cards , and killed the five < unk > of the spear .
but the < unk > didn & apos ; t only kill because of the spear .
they were < unk > each other .
< unk > percent of the deaths happened in < unk > .
we followed the < unk > eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people to do something about it , they said that one of the people had become so old , because of his age , and we still killed him with the < unk > .
but at the same time , they had a clear understanding of forests that was quite astonishing .
their predators were able to smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away , and determine which animal species these animals were .
in the early & apos ; 90s , i got a really astonishing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i & apos ; d be interested to go to haiti and to find the secret communities that the < unk > of strength and < unk > were used by < unk > and < unk > .
now , to give a sense to that , i had to , of course , know something about this remarkable faith in the world and < unk > is not an cult of black magic .
on the contrary , it & apos ; s a complex social system .
it & apos ; s interesting .
if i asked you to science , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , < unk > , whatever .
a continent will always leave because the guess that in sub-saharan africa there was no religious belief . of course , there was one and < unk > is just the < unk > of those very deep religious minds , which was in the tragic diaspora of the city .
but what makes it so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
living through the living people & apos ; s minds .
minds can be transformed by under the great water , answers to the rhythm of dance , to < unk > the soul of the living , so that the < unk > for a brief moment becomes the god .
< unk > people like to say , & quot ; your white man goes to church and you say about god .
we & apos ; re dancing in temple and becoming god . & quot ;
and because you & apos ; re obsessed , are you going to move away from the mind . how can you make damage ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : < unk > in a < unk > coal , < unk > coal , an astonishing graph of the mind of the mind to influence the body that it & apos ; s < unk > when it & apos ; s moved to a private sector .
now , of all the people i met , they were the < unk > from the sierra nevada de < unk > in < unk > , the most extreme one .
offspring of the old < unk > civilization that < unk > the joined < unk > of colombia , and in the aftermath of it came to a tough < unk > system that < unk > across that < unk > < unk > .
in a continent & apos ; s continent , these people were the only people who had never been conquered by the < unk > .
until today , they & apos ; re ruled by a ritual < unk > , but education is very extraordinary .
the young people will be separated at age three and four years from their families apart and in a more serious world of < unk > , in < unk > at the < unk > of the glaciers for 18 years , and two times from the < unk > & apos ; s lap , the < unk > world .
and during that entire time , they & apos ; re introduced culturally in the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayer and their prayer only , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing < unk > , you & apos ; ll see one day after a while , and for the first time in your life , when you live , when the sun turned 18 years old , you see a < unk > . and in this < unk > moment of consciousness , when the first thing starts to be amazing ?
it & apos ; s so wonderful . you need to protect it . & quot ;
they call themselves the older brothers and say we are the younger brothers , which are responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
always when we think of < unk > and landscape , we either < unk > and < unk > and < unk > < unk > < unk > , who & apos ; s a < unk > thought , or say , these people are more connected to nature than we are connected to .
so , < unk > aren & apos ; t even < unk > , they & apos ; re < unk > .
it doesn & apos ; t have a lot of space in the < unk > < unk > of < unk > or < unk > of tibet , but still , through time and ritual , a < unk > < unk > of the earth that & apos ; s based on the idea that you get from .
now , what does this mean ?
it means that some little kid will come out of the house who believe that the mountain is a < unk > , who will be their own destiny , will be a very different human , and a different relationship on that mountain , or that location , from a small child , is an < unk > .
whether it & apos ; s a spirit of an mind or a bunch of < unk > , irrelevant .
what & apos ; s interesting is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of < unk > colombia , and i believed that these forests are there to grow .
that made me to another human being , among the friends of < unk > who believe that these forests were the < unk > of < unk > and the < unk > < unk > and the < unk > minds that < unk > the world & apos ; s < unk > .
now , if you start to look at the idea of creating these cultures , you can understand some extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it & apos ; s a picture i took last april in the amazon forest .
this is < unk > , which many of you have heard of , the world & apos ; s most powerful was actually < unk > from the repertoire of the repertoire .
what & apos ; s < unk > about < unk > is not just the < unk > potential of this thing , but its < unk > . it & apos ; s made out of really two different sources . on the one hand , there & apos ; s a < unk > , that is a series of < unk > .
this plant contains some very strong < unk > that are very similar to serotonin , < unk > and very similar .
if you & apos ; ve ever seen the < unk > , < unk > this stuff , this substance , which has made it out of different ways as well .
so < unk > < unk > is kind of like getting out of a < unk > , < unk > of < unk > paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it & apos ; s not produced as much as the resolution of reality , it & apos ; s creating the resolution of reality .
i even had a professor with my professor , richard evan < unk > , the man who introduced the < unk > < unk > with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the < unk > years , who you weren & apos ; t thinking about it .
but the thing about < unk > is that they can & apos ; t be unless they & apos ; re < unk > , because , of course , through one of the human < unk > enzyme , < unk > enzyme , < unk > enzyme .
they can only be carried to some of the other chemicals that come in with some other chemicals , it & apos ; s going to < unk > .
now what & apos ; s fascinating is that the < unk > that contain < unk > within the < unk > are , < unk > of exactly the same kind that is necessary to < unk > the < unk > , so ask yourself .
how can these people from an < unk > of 80,000 species , plants don & apos ; t find these two < unk > plants that are combining when they & apos ; re creating a kind of < unk > version , so the sum of the sum is greater than the sum of its parts ?
we use these great < unk > , trying to make errors , which turns out to be meaningless .
but the native americans are asked to say , & quot ; the plant is speaking to us . & quot ;
so , what does it mean ?
this tribe , the < unk > , has 17 varieties of < unk > that you & apos ; re all seeing at a great distance in the forest for our eyes as one form .
and they & apos ; re like , & quot ; i think they & apos ; re asking what they & apos ; re doing , & quot ; and they & apos ; re thinking , & quot ; i think you & apos ; re a little bit of plants .
i mean , you don & apos ; t even know ? & quot ; and i said , & quot ; no . & quot ;
well , it turns out you get every one of those 17 varieties at < unk > , and they & apos ; re singing to you in a number of different < unk > .
well , it doesn & apos ; t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it & apos ; s much more interesting than < unk > < unk > .
now , < unk > the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult position , it & apos ; s as < unk > and < unk > , but somehow you & apos ; re looking at the past , while the real world , is our real world .
so , the fact that in the 20th century , in 300 years , you will not be aware of your wars or technological innovations , but rather , as an era in which we & apos ; ve been believe , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural change isn & apos ; t active either .
all cultures have always been involved with dance with new < unk > .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
the sioux stopped being less based on sioux , upon the bow and arrow , than the americans stopped being americans , when they stop being horse and < unk > tasks .
now , not change and technology < unk > the integrity of < unk > . it & apos ; s power . it & apos ; s ugly face of power .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i study far more research , you & apos ; ll see the ugly face of political work .
you know , the genocide , the < unk > extinction of people gets convicted of in general , but the < unk > , the destruction of the people , is not only convicted , but it & apos ; s not just < unk > and < unk > as part of an act .
and you can & apos ; t understand the suffering < unk > unless you experienced it at an < unk > level .
i visited with a young < unk > of < unk > < unk > in < unk > < unk > through < unk > , and only after i came to trip that i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear about , 6,000 people , and the future , and the millions of justice .
so , the father of this boy & apos ; s boy was identified as a followers of the < unk > lama .
that meant that in the chinese invasion was instantly killed .
his uncle < unk > into the diaspora that got people to nepal .
his mother was locked in as a punishment for -- to be wealthy to the crime .
he & apos ; s been touched in prison for two years at a time when she was four , to hide under her < unk > , because she did not live without him .
the sister who did this brave act was brought in a < unk > .
one day she came out of < unk > and for these < unk > , she & apos ; d have to get them to a labor camp for seven years .
the suffering can be < unk > , but the most profound spirit of human beings is something that & apos ; s more fragile .
and finally , we really are facing a choice : do we want to live in an < unk > world of < unk > or in a < unk > world of diversity ?
margaret < unk > , who had said before she died that it was your greatest fear that as we move towards a text , < unk > , < unk > , we & apos ; re not just < unk > the entire range of human imagination , but we & apos ; re starting to see one < unk > .
and it & apos ; s come to mind that our species may have existed in 600,000 years .
the < unk > revolution that brought us agriculture , and that & apos ; s the cult of the < unk > < unk > , the poetry of poetry through the were < unk > out of either water history and hierarchy and hierarchy , hierarchy , specialization instead of 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world as we & apos ; ve seen it is hardly 300 years old .
now that there & apos ; s a common story that doesn & apos ; t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we & apos ; re facing in the thousands of years .
when we ask these < unk > to ask about the importance of the human being , they answer them at 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we & apos ; re going to be the ability to be , what we are : people with great consciousness that are aware of the importance of all the people and gardens a space , has to be < unk > . and there are great optimism .
and here & apos ; s a photo that i took out in the northern part of the < unk > as i went with < unk > on the < unk > , and this man , < unk > , told me a wonderful story of his < unk > .
the canadian government is not always very good at the inuit , and during the < unk > years in the course of the course of our rule , they were forced to pull into the settlements .
the grandfather named this guy refused to go .
the family who was scared of his life got away all the weapons and all the tools .
now , you have to know that the inuit don & apos ; t feel fear of the cold ; they & apos ; re using it to their advantage .
the fish that were originally made in their glass originally from fish that & apos ; s been made in < unk > .
the man & apos ; s grandfather wasn & apos ; t scared at the arctic night or the still storm .
he went outside , and his pants went down , and he started < unk > , and he started putting his hand , and when the feces started to shoot him up , he shaped it into the form of a < unk > .
he was < unk > < unk > on the sides of the stick , and when it was entirely frozen , he took a dog with it .
he < unk > the dog and he painted a < unk > , took the skeleton of the dog , put in a < unk > , put a dog on the dog & apos ; s head , and < unk > through the < unk > < unk > < unk > .
this is not something you can do .
and in many ways , that & apos ; s a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and everything around the world .
the canadian government , in 1999 , gave the complete control over an area back in 1999 , which is bigger than california and texas .
it & apos ; s our new home . it & apos ; s called < unk > .
it & apos ; s an independent area . they control all the < unk > .
an astonishing example of how a nation , a nation , a state that & apos ; s in search of its job market and can be done .
and finally , i think it & apos ; s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to this distant goals on earth to realize that they & apos ; re not removed at all .
they are the < unk > of somebody .
they represent part of human imagination that < unk > into past times , and for all of us , the dreams of those kids become like the dreams of our own children in the five times of hope .
what we try to do at national geographic is we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that < unk > -- we believe that < unk > isn & apos ; t compelling , but we think storytelling can transform the world and therefore we & apos ; re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million < unk > every month .
nations saw our < unk > send .
our magazines are read millions of years .
and we company a series of travel into the < unk > where we take our audience to places like this of such cultural < unk > , that they & apos ; re < unk > , and hopefully they & apos ; ll be one by other people & apos ; s central relationship to think that it deserves the world .
thank you .
what i & apos ; m first going to show you is the basic work , a new technology that we & apos ; re doing to microsoft as part of exactly a year ago , which is < unk > . and it & apos ; s an environment , whether it & apos ; s local or visual data .
we see a lot of < unk > on digital photos here , which you can < unk > and < unk > , pan , change in any other way .
and it doesn & apos ; t matter how much information we look , how big these collections are or how big the paintings are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is , for example , a scan of the camera , and it & apos ; s in one area of 300 < unk > .
it doesn & apos ; t matter because the only thing that can < unk > the power of a system like this is the number of money on your screen in every moment -- it & apos ; s also a very flexible architecture .
this is an entire book , an example of intelligence < unk > .
this is < unk > house of subject . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it & apos ; s really a text , and not an image , we can do something like this to really show that this is actually a representation of < unk > and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an < unk > .
i wouldn & apos ; t recommend it .
this is a < unk > case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the start of a < unk > .
and that gives you the pleasure , and the good experience is to read a real magazine that & apos ; s a newspaper or a newspaper that & apos ; s a kind of media with several scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
we & apos ; ve designed a wrong ad with very high resolution that & apos ; s much higher than in a normal display , and we & apos ; ve added extra content to it .
if you want to see the functions of that car , you can see it there .
or other models , or even technical < unk > .
and that actually picks up those ideas , those limitations for the top place on the screen .
we hope this doesn & apos ; t necessarily mean more < unk > and other nonsense -- it should not be necessary .
of course , that & apos ; s a very obvious thing for a technology like this .
and i don & apos ; t really want to spend much time here , except that we & apos ; re going to be contributing to this place .
but these are all roads in the streets .
< unk > up at the top of the nasa & apos ; s picture .
so let & apos ; s take a different approach .
this is actually live on the internet now . you can pass it around .
this is a project called < unk > that really connects two different technologies to one another .
one is < unk > , and the other is a very good research on < unk > , which is from noah < unk > , which is an online university of washington , under the ? steve < unk > at < unk > .
and rick < unk > of microsoft & apos ; s research has been done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . this is driven by < unk > .
you can see that if we & apos ; re creating this kind of view of what we can go through images and actually make this experience of very playing very well .
but the spatial orientation is really important here .
so the < unk > made these pictures together so they & apos ; re holding the real room where they all went near the < unk > , and they & apos ; re made in the canadian < unk > , they & apos ; re equal to see elements of slides and slides on either of these < unk > things .
i don & apos ; t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there are some < unk > running around .
i & apos ; d like to spend some of the < unk > < unk > from noah , and that & apos ; s from a early prototype that we & apos ; ve ever worked on in summer to show you what i think is really not the punchline and this technology is .
and we had to worry about the lawyers .
this is a cathedral at the cathedral & apos ; s cathedral of the cathedral , entirely on the computer with images of flickr . just give them < unk > in flickr , and you & apos ; ll get images of men in back and on the < unk > , and so on this looking glass model as a computer model .
so these are the < unk > , and they & apos ; re all on the way in that way , they & apos ; re related to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed i & apos ; m going to work at microsoft after all .
and i & apos ; m grateful for the road there .
i guess you can see that there & apos ; s a lot of different kinds of cameras out there : everything that & apos ; s been < unk > to professional professional professional professional professional , a pretty large number of you that have been put in this environment .
and if possible , i & apos ; ll find some of the weird < unk > .
many of you are < unk > by faces and so on .
some of these are a number of photographs -- there they are .
this is actually a poster by a today & apos ; s lady who was < unk > right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of that environment .
the point here is we can make things with social environment . it & apos ; s now collected data from all the collective memory -- from the whole collective memory of what the earth looks like -- and everything is connected .
all these photos are connected , and it & apos ; s creating something which is greater than the sum of the parts .
they & apos ; re given a model that comes from all this earth .
so think of this as the sequel of the work of stephen < unk > on virtual earth .
and it & apos ; s something that , through the complexity that people use , that grows and use it for the user to make use of .
their own photos are being < unk > by one person who has a different person .
when one & apos ; s done the trouble , and all the holy acts and < unk > , who you & apos ; re all , then my photo is going to be < unk > using all this data and i can use it as a space that & apos ; s < unk > and < unk > it .
and of course , < unk > of all of these are the huge < unk > virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , not just through < unk > or satellite and satellite and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
i get it right ? your software gives you that at a certain time , in the next year , all the images that are used by someone in the world will actually be associated with each other ?
yes . she doesn & apos ; t actually find anything other than to discover .
if you want to < unk > it between the images .
and it does this because of content in the images .
and that & apos ; s really exciting , if you think about the amount of information that a lot of these pictures have .
it & apos ; s like when you do a < unk > search for images where you put sentences into sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what you see is .
but what would it be like to connect with all these pictures ?
and then it & apos ; s the amount of < unk > and the amount of money that makes it really feel enormous . it & apos ; s a classic < unk > .
keep in mind , it & apos ; s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i & apos ; m going to tell you some of the things from my book , which i hope , in reflect with other things that you & apos ; ve heard already . and i & apos ; m going to try to make some connections , if you don & apos ; t notice them .
i & apos ; d like to start with what i call & quot ; official read . & quot ;
official favorite forms of what ?
the official computer came from all the western industrialized societies .
and < unk > < unk > works like this : when our goal is to try to maximize the common citizens of our common citizens , it & apos ; s particularly because of the freedom of the individuals .
the reason for that is that freedom itself is good , valuable , meaningful , sense , a < unk > assumption for human beings .
when people have freedom , then each and every one of us is to do things that maximize our public good , and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more more public they have .
this is , i think , so deeply in our water supply chain , that there & apos ; s no way that would make it to your mind .
and it & apos ; s also deep in our lives .
i & apos ; m going to give you some examples of what & apos ; s enabling modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big deal .
i just want to quickly say a little bit about < unk > .
there & apos ; s away in my supermarket when you don & apos ; t have the 10 extra dna sequences , 12 < unk > that you could buy a large number of its own lettuce in which you & apos ; re not good for a store .
so that & apos ; s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to business to the < unk > store -- speaker , < unk > , < unk > , a < unk > , radio , and in that one electronics , there & apos ; s so many < unk > facilities .
we & apos ; re able to put < unk > million different ways of putting together the components that are offered in this one store .
you have to admit that that & apos ; s a huge set of choices .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a period of time when i was a boy that you could have on every telephone that you wanted as long as he came from bell .
you rented your phone . you didn & apos ; t buy it .
and a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
those days are over .
we now have almost an infinite selection of telephones , especially in the world of cell phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- < unk > , < unk > , < unk > < unk > .
and if you haven & apos ; t seen this in your business yet , you can be sure you & apos ; re going to be soon .
and what it does is it gets people to run into business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is & quot ; no . & quot ;
it & apos ; s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn & apos ; t too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more powerful than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it & apos ; s no longer the case in the united states that you & apos ; re going to get a doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , she & apos ; ll get a ph.d. , and the doctor says , & quot ; we could do a , or we could make b . & quot ;
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , & quot ; doctor , what do i do ? & quot ;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risk .
what do you want to do ?
and if you said , & quot ; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? & quot ;
the doctor says , & quot ; but i & apos ; m not you . & quot ;
the result is -- we call it & quot ; patients autonomy . & quot ; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , one of the other forms of responsibilities is to make decisions from something white -- something & apos ; s < unk > doctor & apos ; s best , and i don & apos ; t think < unk > .
there are tremendous marketing for < unk > drugs for people like you and me , which , if you think about it , doesn & apos ; t make any sense at all , because we don & apos ; t buy it .
why don & apos ; t they care if we don & apos ; t buy ?
the answer is , they expect us to add the doctor in the next morning to ask for a change in the prescription .
something about how our identity is now a choice of choice , how this slide is supposed to show you .
we don & apos ; t < unk > , we invent them .
and we & apos ; re about to < unk > ourselves like we want .
that means that every day you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the < unk > was that almost everybody had one , and it quickly < unk > as quickly as they could , and then kids got kids as they could .
the only choice was & quot ; who , & quot ; not when , and not what they did .
nowadays everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to .
and it & apos ; s not because they & apos ; re less smart , it & apos ; s not because they & apos ; re less carefully .
it & apos ; s because they & apos ; re all engaged with other things , they ask themselves , & quot ; should i marry , or should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or should i be a career ? & quot ;
they are all < unk > questions .
and you & apos ; ll answer those questions , whether this means getting all the tasks that i & apos ; m going to give you , not having a good grade in my class .
and in fact , you should . those are important to ask questions .
work -- we & apos ; re blessed , as carl 10 times the technology that enables us to work every single day on the planet -- to work on the < unk > hotel .
by the way , there & apos ; s a corner that i & apos ; m not going to tell you about , that works on .
i & apos ; m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice that we have in terms of making decisions , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can play our kids with football , and we have our cell phones on one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop may have on our lap .
and even though they & apos ; re all shut down , every minute we take our child on the < unk > & apos ; s < unk > , we & apos ; re going to ask ourselves , & quot ; should i embrace that call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write that letter ? & quot ;
and even though the answer to the question & quot ; no , & quot ; it & apos ; s certainly going to be very different from your child & apos ; s experience very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things , and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world that we lived in looked like this .
so i mean , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world that we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , are there good news or bad news ?
the answer is & quot ; yes . & quot ;
we all know what & apos ; s good about it , so i & apos ; m going to talk about what & apos ; s bad about it .
all those choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , at its most important , is it & apos ; s < unk > not to break out .
with so many options you can choose , it & apos ; s very difficult to choose .
i & apos ; m going to give you another more positive example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague i had access to < unk > < unk > , the giant < unk > of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 percent < unk > who took advantage of employer , taking care of participation by two percent .
you & apos ; re offering 50 < unk > -- 10 percent less employees than if they & apos ; d just offer five . why ?
because it & apos ; s 50 of them who are choice ; it & apos ; s so hard to decide which one you & apos ; re going to choose in the morning .
and then morning , and then morning , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , will of course never come .
understand that it doesn & apos ; t just mean that people need to eat when they go to the retirement , because they don & apos ; t have enough money to go on , it also means making the decisions so hard that they miss big health .
it & apos ; s not taking participation until 5,000 us a year from < unk > , which would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it does make the world look like this .
they really want to make the decision right when it & apos ; s for all last , right ?
you don & apos ; t want to choose the wrong investment in fund , or even the wrong < unk > .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that if we make the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of choice as if we had created the opportunity to decide less .
and there are several reasons for that .
one of them is , we think , by the large array of different < unk > , if you buy one , and it & apos ; s not perfect -- and what < unk > is perfect ? it & apos ; s easy to imagine that you & apos ; d have a different choice , and what & apos ; s your decisions to do .
the more possibilities there is , the easier it is to regret at all to regret that is wrong with the choices you make .
secondly , what economists call < unk > .
dan gilbert made a big point this morning by telling how much the species in which we value things depends on what we compare to .
well , if there & apos ; s lots of alternatives to this , it & apos ; s simply to imagine attractive properties of alternatives that they < unk > doing less than the alternatives they chose to .
here & apos ; s an example . for those of you who are not a new yorker , i apologize .
but here is what you should have thought .
here & apos ; s some of the other things that i & apos ; m talking about .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? & quot ; damn & quot ; the man thinks & quot ; it & apos ; s august .
everybody in my local neighborhood is gone .
i & apos ; d park right in front of my house . & quot ;
and he spends two weeks following the thought that he & apos ; d missed , day over his day , to have a great parking lot .
< unk > lower happiness that we get by our selection , even though what we & apos ; ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are selection , the more attractive properties of those selection are considered into focus .
here & apos ; s another example .
now , this cartoon does a few statements .
he & apos ; s making a statement about living and maybe things slow .
but one of the things he does is always who they decide to do one thing , they don & apos ; t choose to do other things .
and those other things like a lot of attractive properties , and it & apos ; s going to be what they & apos ; re going to do less force .
three , expectations of expectations .
this hit me when i wanted to replace my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time when they were just < unk > , and they were buying them , and they were poor ; they were incredibly < unk > ; and if they carried them long enough and often well , they took out , & quot ; ok . & quot ;
so , to buy new jeans after many years of training , the old man , and i said , & quot ; i wish i & apos ; d like to buy some jeans here is my size . & quot ;
and the sales person said , & quot ; do you want to walk away , slightly < unk > or long ?
do you want to clean up or acid ? i want to clean and acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
if you want to cut down , like a lot of people , blah , blah , blah ... & quot ; and so on , he talked .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered myself , & quot ; i would love to have the only species that used to be . & quot ;
he had no idea what it was , so i spent an hour < unk > all these damn jeans , and he walked up to the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best jeans i ever had .
i did better . all those choice allowed me to better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason i felt worse was because of all these available choices , my expectations for what & apos ; s good for a few jeans , went up high .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when there was just in a way .
when they got to 100 , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn & apos ; t perfect .
so i compared to what i had expected , and what i expected , compared to what i expected , compared to what i expected .
adding people & apos ; s choices to people & apos ; s lives are inevitably increasing expectations that people have about how well these possibilities will be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of < unk > knows this , because if you did , you would all know what you & apos ; re talking about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it was all better than everything that was worse than everything worse was than everything worse , it was possible for people to experience who were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live in -- we & apos ; re < unk > citizens , similar to perfection -- the best thing you can hope for is things to be as good as you would expect by them .
they will never feel < unk > because your expectations , my expectations are < unk > .
the secret to the < unk > -- that & apos ; s what they & apos ; ve all come for -- the secret to the < unk > is low expectations .
i want to say -- a brief moment -- that i married with a woman , and she & apos ; s quite wonderful .
i couldn & apos ; t have done better . i didn & apos ; t < unk > myself .
but < unk > isn & apos ; t always a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of the < unk > of a < unk > jeans when there & apos ; s just one way to buy it , and you & apos ; re wondering why you & apos ; re responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible ? what can you have ?
when there are hundreds of different kinds of jeans available , and they & apos ; re going to be < unk > , and they & apos ; re asking , & quot ; who & apos ; s in charge ? & quot ;
and it & apos ; s also very clear that the answer to that question is , it & apos ; s you .
you could have done better than that .
we don & apos ; t have 100 different kinds of jeans in the < unk > , there & apos ; s no excuse for errors .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are well , then they feel disappointed about them , they filter themselves out .
clinical depression didn & apos ; t happen in the world in the last generation .
i think it & apos ; s a < unk > -- not the only thing , but a < unk > < unk > to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experience because your sense are so high , and then when you & apos ; re going to explain it to be these experiences .
and so the thing is that we & apos ; re getting better , objective , we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is official < unk > , which we & apos ; re all thinking for right , completely wrong . it & apos ; s not true .
there & apos ; s no question that & apos ; s a little bit better than no choice , but it & apos ; s not following more choices than a little choice .
there & apos ; s a magical amount . i don & apos ; t know what it is .
i & apos ; m pretty sure we & apos ; ve missed that point in which choice improve our genome .
now , as an < unk > question -- i & apos ; m almost done -- as an well question to think about this : this is what makes all these choices possible into the developed world , is wealth of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we & apos ; ve heard a lot of them whose problem isn & apos ; t that great .
their problem is that they have too little .
so the things i & apos ; m talking about are an weird problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what & apos ; s so frustrating and angry is that steve < unk > told you yesterday about how these expensive and heavy car seats aren & apos ; t helping . it & apos ; s a waste of money .
what i & apos ; m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decisions -- it & apos ; s not easy to help .
they even hurt .
they care that we & apos ; re doing worse .
if something that allowed the people of our society to make such decisions to the societies where people changed too little selection , would not just improve people & apos ; s lives , but it would also improve our dignity .
economists call this an < unk > application .
< unk > will make sure that it & apos ; s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these huge < unk > make us < unk > .
finally , you just read this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , & quot ; ah ! what does that fish know ? & quot ;
you know there & apos ; s nothing done in this < unk > . & quot ;
< unk > imagination , a < unk > view of the world -- and that & apos ; s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i got , in my view , that the fish knows something .
because the truth is , if you break the < unk > , so that everything is possible , you don & apos ; t have freedom . you have paralysis .
when they break up the < unk > so everything is possible , they lower happiness .
they increase the paralysis ; they increase the happiness .
everyone needs a < unk > .
that & apos ; s almost to safety -- possibly even for the fish , definitely for us .
but the < unk > is a recipe for misery , and , i think , disaster < unk > .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of these projects earlier , about the human genome , and what that might mean , and the discovery of the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we & apos ; re going from a new point of view : we & apos ; ve digitized biology , and now we & apos ; re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new life and build new life .
we & apos ; ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what is life ? it & apos ; s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and look at different levels .
we have different approaches to doing it till the minimum components .
we & apos ; ve lived almost 20 years , and when we sequenced the < unk > , the change in the analog world has come from the analog world of biology to digital world .
now we & apos ; re trying to ask ourselves , can we regenerate life , or can we create new life , from this digital universe ?
that & apos ; s the map of a small organism , phone calls , the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we & apos ; ve tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we & apos ; ve managed to cut it down to about a hundred or something that & apos ; s here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust me . but if we all look at these genes that we & apos ; re able to eliminate one by one , it & apos ; s very unlikely that it would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it & apos ; s the only way we are going to go forward is to actually < unk > what allows us to vary the individual components , and therefore to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we began with the question , can we < unk > a chromosome ?
does chemistry make these really big molecules to make what & apos ; s never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
and a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of < unk > chemical material .
we were in the minds of exponential life of exponentially .
our genetic code has evolved to write very slowly , but it & apos ; s < unk > , and our last point now would be to an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took some years to run a trial before we did the first experiments .
and it turned out to be very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little pieces of dna , 30 or 50 letters long , but it & apos ; s an < unk > process , so the longer you make a piece of cells , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put together these little bits , and we had to fix the errors .
so that was the first attempt to try and start with the digital information , the genome x play x .
it & apos ; s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made small pieces , we made a < unk > , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
now the exciting phase came when we took this piece of < unk > chemical and put it into a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
so the viral particles were then removed by the cells , and they came back and killed e. business .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that this model was exactly < unk > .
they laughed more than the one they & apos ; re doing here .
so we think this is a situation where software can actually grow its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole < unk > chromosome . it & apos ; s got more than < unk > genetic code . so we thought we & apos ; re going to do it on ; we & apos ; re the size of the size of the sizes of the earth & apos ; s cell to see what made by the < unk > .
design is the key , and if you want to take digital information to the computer in your computer , this digital information has to really be quite < unk > .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 was the standard data set at a 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 error in the original 30 . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to create the pieces that are < unk > for 50 letters , and that need to be < unk > with other < unk > , to make those smaller < unk > .
we & apos ; ve built unique elements there .
you may have heard how we & apos ; ve built < unk > .
think about it : we have a < unk > code : c , g and t .
so , < unk > of these letters -- these letters actually encode amino acids , and there & apos ; s a single purpose for every amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first we only signed .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we & apos ; ve constructed the bits so that we could just break them down with enzymes ; there & apos ; s a enzymes that fix them and then bring them back together .
and we started creating pieces , starting to run back up to < unk > letters , adding these each other to < unk > < unk > to put together these < unk > , until < unk > .
in every step , we made these pieces in the country so we could sequence them , because we were trying to create a very robust process that they & apos ; ll see in a minute .
we try to get to the point of view .
so , this looks like a < unk > .
if we get to those very large < unk > -- over 100,000 feet -- they & apos ; re not going to grow them just in e. business . it & apos ; s going to grow all the possibility of modern molecular biology , and so we & apos ; ve entered other kinds of mechanisms .
we knew a mechanism by a mechanism of < unk > < unk > , which uses biology to fix dna that can < unk > those pieces .
so here & apos ; s an example of it . there & apos ; s one organism called < unk > < unk > of three million feet of radiation .
you & apos ; ll see in the top field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has become the same as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely < unk > , they can actually live in a vacuum .
i & apos ; m absolutely sure life exists in space and moving on the quest for conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there are lots and lots of them out there .
here & apos ; s a map of the molecule that we & apos ; ve created by using these processes -- in fact , we & apos ; ve been using only < unk > with the right design of the pieces , we put them together .
this is not < unk > it & apos ; s a < unk > < unk > .
it & apos ; s such a large molecule that we can actually see it in the air .
this is footage over six seconds .
that & apos ; s the publication that we finished recently .
this is over < unk > letter to < unk > code , and it & apos ; s the largest molecule that & apos ; s ever built with < unk > structure that & apos ; s ever been created by people .
it & apos ; s over 300 million in value .
if we print it out with a < unk > of 10 or with no read it , it would contain < unk > pages just to < unk > those genetic code .
now , how do we take a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it & apos ; s very simple with a virus . it & apos ; s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it & apos ; s also easier if you do it in a way that we do ; you just take the nucleus out and you put another in there , and that & apos ; s exactly what you & apos ; ve all heard about a cloning .
at < unk > , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but it & apos ; s only recently that we & apos ; ve shown you can get a full transplant from one cell to the other cell and it & apos ; s activate it .
we < unk > the chromosome of a chromosome . < unk > said , are these two others , like humans and mice . we had some < unk > on that to pick this chromosome . we were able to destroy it with all the things that we & apos ; d like , and we had a very amazing number of them .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought here & apos ; s the end , but we & apos ; ve tried to push the process a little bit further .
that & apos ; s the evolution of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that took a second chromosome or a third of < unk > , every time thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species of < unk > .
so people imagine evolution as a gene that is changed at a time when there is a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called < unk > , which are actually < unk > dna .
the chromosome was that in the cell ; the chromosomes that we & apos ; ve put in it already .
it was < unk > in the cell and realized that the other chromosome as the foreign material , and so we only had one cell at the end with a new chromosome .
it < unk > blue about the genes that we & apos ; ve put in .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and completely into a new species based on the new software that we & apos ; ve given to the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , that & apos ; s what we & apos ; d done .
it may sound like genomic < unk > , but we can move it by moving the < unk > , changing things quite dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the right answer -- which is based on < unk > billion years of evolution .
and i & apos ; ve argued that we may be creating a new form of hope in the ocean in which there may be massive new < unk > based on this digital design .
why would we do that ?
i think it & apos ; s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we & apos ; ve gone from six billion to nine billion people to the next 40 years to 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in provide .
today there are three people on this planet for every one of whom exists in the year ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh water and clean water , medicine , gas billion people .
it & apos ; s going to be a challenge to bring nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , $ < unk > billion oil . that & apos ; s a hundred million users a day .
when we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there is the whole co2 from this material which lands into the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the < unk > of the future .
< unk > had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we are still on the boundaries of the biological reality of the biological reality , and that of this idea .
we have technologies today because of this fast < unk > to do what we call < unk > genetics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can create millions of chromosomes a day .
when you imagine making those 20 million different genes or these processes to optimize < unk > or new vaccines , we can change with one small team more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it & apos ; s just < unk > selection . we can then < unk > < unk > , production of chemicals or < unk > and so on .
this is a picture of physical < unk > that we & apos ; re working with , where you & apos ; re actually sort of < unk > and designing new species < unk > .
you know , we don & apos ; t necessarily know what it will look like , we know exactly what the genetic code will look like .
so we are focusing on the fourth generation .
now you & apos ; ve seen corn recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have the < unk > of the < unk > and third generation which are pretty soon , that will get much higher , like < unk > or different kinds of < unk > .
but , as we think the only way that biology will < unk > a huge impact on the cost of food or the limitation of their availability is when we see co2 as the starting material , and therefore we work on the cells that way .
and we think we & apos ; re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that & apos ; s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , at about < unk > miles deep , near almost < unk > miles .
it will transform co2 in methane from the use of hydrogen as energy source .
we & apos ; re going to use < unk > co2 that would be simply < unk > , < unk > the co2 in the fuel that & apos ; s in order to make this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions in life .
you know , we have a real -- < unk > goals like the entire < unk > industry . right ? if you can & apos ; t do this at ted , where else ? a < unk > of energy .
but in the same way , we & apos ; re working on using the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
you & apos ; ve seen flu this year , we & apos ; re always on the back and we & apos ; ve got a dollar a little bit if it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by creating more general vaccines in the field of vaccines .
this is , perhaps , how the future might look with changes can now accelerate the number of synthetic bacteria , < unk > , and possibly even < unk > .
we are taken away from people . our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do it . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how this machine works .
so it & apos ; s as far . and for those of you who weren & apos ; t there , the lhc , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that & apos ; s ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a second after a second after the universe -- and that until 600 million times a second .
it & apos ; s just so ambitious , you know ?
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we & apos ; re taking imagery of these detectors in detectors .
on this one i & apos ; m working . it & apos ; s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
there & apos ; s a spectacular picture of atlas into the building so you can see the scale .
on the 10th of september last year , the machine for the first time .
and this image was taken by atlas .
there & apos ; s a huge amount of damage going on in the < unk > .
it & apos ; s an image of the first < unk > that & apos ; s going around the lhc , then < unk > with a part of the lhc to allow you to have an < unk > of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on 10th september , we knew that the machine works , what a great triumph .
i don & apos ; t know if this created the biggest < unk > , or this , when somebody went to the google page and found the front page like this .
it means that we reach a cultural impact next to the scientific method .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- these golden wires down here .
these wires run < unk > when the machine runs on < unk > .
now , the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , & quot ; no , you don & apos ; t . these are little wires . & quot ;
they can afford it because if you < unk > it very well , they will become something called < unk > .
so at minus < unk > degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can form the tension .
in one of the connections between talking about < unk > magnets in the lhc , there was an < unk > .
so the wires breaks in slightly and < unk > < unk > suddenly < unk > resistance .
this was the result .
well , it & apos ; s all < unk > when you imagine that the magnets is going to weigh over 20 tons and move by about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets we & apos ; re damaged .
and they had to remove what we were doing .
we & apos ; re < unk > it , we & apos ; re < unk > it .
so , they & apos ; re all back to their way now .
at the end of march , the lhc will be < unk > < unk > again .
we & apos ; re going to turn it back and expect to be able to get the first data in june or july , and we & apos ; re going to continue this journey to try and find out what the building blocks of the universe is .
now , of course , in a way , accidents like this will < unk > the debate about the value of science and < unk > on such boundaries . it & apos ; s easy to reject something like that .
i think the fact that it & apos ; s so heavy , the fact that we & apos ; re moving beyond our limitations , is the value of things like the lhc .
i & apos ; m going to leave my < unk > words to a english scientist . < unk > < unk > , who , as i guess the world & apos ; s most popular experiments , his < unk > , his name is michael < unk > , he says , & apos ; s the idea that & quot ; s not anything that & quot ; success & quot ; s so dangerous . & quot ;
thank you .
i & apos ; m a writer .
books to write books is my profession , but of course it & apos ; s more than that .
it & apos ; s also my great , life of love and as well .
and i don & apos ; t expect ever to change .
however , a little bit of recent in my life and my career that made me think about all of my work was completely < unk > about this work .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called < unk > < unk > , < unk > , love -- that , unlike all my previous books , for some of the world & apos ; s previous books , and a < unk > .
the result is that i don & apos ; t care where i come from , but i & apos ; m being treated as if i & apos ; m < unk > to the end .
seriously -- get a little < unk > !
for example , does she worry about me and say , & quot ; don & apos ; t you fear that you & apos ; re never going to win that success ?
don & apos ; t you worry about < unk > your whole life and never creating a book that anyone in the world cares about ? never , ever , < unk > ?
okay , it & apos ; s real courage .
however , it would be worse if i wouldn & apos ; t remember that i had over 20 years ago when i was the first teenager told me i was going to be a writer , with the same kind of < unk > response .
people said , < unk > , have you not been afraid to never succeed ?
don & apos ; t you worry that the humiliation of an < unk > killing you ?
you & apos ; re not afraid you & apos ; ve been < unk > your life and out of it , and you & apos ; re going to die on a more < unk > dreams -- your mouth is filled with the head of failure ?
that & apos ; s pretty much , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , yes , < unk > answer .
yeah , i & apos ; m afraid of all those things .
and i & apos ; d always had .
and i & apos ; m scared a lot more things that no one else would get .
algae like algae -- and other < unk > things .
but i & apos ; ve been thinking about the writing that i & apos ; ve been talking about this recently and i wonder : why ?
is that sensible ?
does it make sense that somebody should be expected to be scared of doing the work he & apos ; s facing ?
and what it is with the creative companies that they & apos ; re making insecure of the brain system -- in a way that other professions don & apos ; t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can & apos ; t remember a chemist in his 40 years as a chemist , where he asked if he & apos ; d be afraid to be chemist .
john < unk > , who & apos ; s -- who & apos ; s got it ?
it just didn & apos ; t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemist did not get the reputation of people who were paid for centuries .
we writers seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative writers , seem to have this call , mentally unstable .
all they have to do is to look at these really great heads of really great heads just from the 20th century that young and often killed by hand .
and even the ones that weren & apos ; t actually < unk > , seemed to have been neglected by their talents .
norman < unk > said , just before his death in his last interview , < unk > of every books i have killed me a little bit further .
a extraordinary statement that they can make about their life .
but we don & apos ; t even know when we hear somebody like that , because we & apos ; ve been familiar with this kind of time , and somehow we & apos ; ve been asking the notion that creativity and suffering and kind of < unk > -- that art always leads to the end .
the question that i & apos ; d like to ask you today is this idea that & apos ; s perfectly fine for you ?
do you feel comfortable with that ? because , given only one centimeter -- i don & apos ; t feel comfortable with this notion at all .
i find them < unk > .
and i find them dangerous . and i don & apos ; t want to watch them be taken over the next century .
i like it better if we & apos ; re < unk > our creative creative experiences .
and i definitely know it & apos ; s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , starting to start this dark cycle of the guess -- especially in the fact that i & apos ; m in my career right now .
that is -- look , i & apos ; m pretty young . i & apos ; m only about 40 years old .
i may have other 40 more < unk > in me .
and it & apos ; s extremely likely that all i & apos ; m going to write from the world & apos ; s work , when the < unk > success of my last book , was right ?
i say to it because we & apos ; re all kind of friends now -- it & apos ; s probably most likely that my biggest success here is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
that & apos ; s the kind of thinking that people can get to start at nine o & apos ; clock in the morning , i don & apos ; t want to .
i & apos ; d rather continue this work that i love .
so the question is , how ?
in some time of < unk > , i feel that i have to continue to write , a kind of < unk > psychological drive .
somehow i have to find a way of writing a safe distance from my mind to true distance and my very natural < unk > about what the reaction is to the writing .
while i & apos ; ve been looking for models this this this past year , i & apos ; ve been looking for the past , and i & apos ; ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have better or more sustainable ideas about it than we can do with people like creativity .
that quest led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please join me , because the circle will close .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn & apos ; t believe creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of < unk > < unk > , who comes from a distant , unknown source to people -- for < unk > , unknown reasons .
the greeks called the < unk > < unk > of creativity < unk > because of them .
from socrates , the fact that he believed that he had an < unk > , who would give him the < unk > < unk > out of the distance .
the she had the same idea , they called , & quot ; < unk > creative spirit , & quot ; a < unk > genius .
that & apos ; s great . the roman doesn & apos ; t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius of these kinds of magical creatures that believed that it would literally be in the walls of a < unk > -- sort of like < unk > , the < unk > , the < unk > , the < unk > result , the < unk > result of labor and the invisible work , the invisible .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there & apos ; s the distance i talked about -- the psychological < unk > that will protect you from your job .
and everybody knew it was working , right ?
the artist & apos ; s artist & apos ; s artist has been protected before things , like , too much < unk > , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn & apos ; t look at everything for you , everybody knew you had that kind of genius that helped you .
if your work < unk > -- not just your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was slightly paralyzed .
so the people in the west thought a really long time about creativity .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let & apos ; s put the human individual center in the universe -- about all the gods and opportunity , and there & apos ; s no more room for creatures to embrace it .
it & apos ; s the beginning of the rational vaccine , and people started to believe that creativity has come completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you & apos ; ve heard people like this or artists , instead of what i & apos ; m saying -- instead , he & apos ; s got a genius .
i got to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think that there & apos ; s a naked person to allow him to think that he thinks he & apos ; s like the tank , like that video and the essence and the source of all the scientific , incredible < unk > is a little bit small , a < unk > !
it & apos ; s like asking people to swallow the sun .
the light you & apos ; ve got light and all the light you & apos ; ve got , you & apos ; ve got all these < unk > expectations about success .
and i think that this kind of surgery has wiped out our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that & apos ; s true , and i think it & apos ; s true -- i think it & apos ; s the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps a ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can < unk > this < unk > , 500 years of < unk > , not just in a < unk > talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who were actually < unk > scientific research on the idea of -- basically -- < unk > , that people are < unk > and < unk > to their projects like this .
i & apos ; m probably not going to take all of you on that journey .
but the question i want to ask is , why not ?
why not think about it that way ?
because it just as much sense as anything else i & apos ; ve heard from when it came to explain the absolute < unk > of the creative process of creativity .
it & apos ; s a process that , like everybody knows , who & apos ; s ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- doesn & apos ; t always put it together .
and in fact , sometimes he can feel just < unk > .
i had a encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet < unk > stone , who & apos ; s now over 90 , who & apos ; s been part of their entire life , and she told me that , as she was in the < unk > virginia , she was going out and she was talking about the landscape .
she said it would be like a giant train of air .
they were going to < unk > the land .
it felt like it was coming , because it would < unk > the earth under your feet .
she knew she could only do one of those times , and that was -- in her words , < unk > running like the devil .
and she ran like the devil while she was followed by this poem , it was about getting fast enough to a leaf and getting a pencil , so that if you had to get it through it through , through it , you & apos ; d catch it , and put it on .
in others , she wasn & apos ; t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she couldn & apos ; t run the house and the poem through it , and she left it . she said it on land and -- as she said , reach out to another poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i & apos ; ll never forget -- she said there were moments in which they actually missed it .
so she & apos ; s walking around the house , and she & apos ; s looking for the paper and the poem through her , and she & apos ; s just taking a pen and then -- she said -- it was so as if she & apos ; s going to reach out and put it .
and she did the poem with his tail , and then she pulled it back into her body , and took it to paper .
so with these opportunities , the poem happened , and intact on paper -- but backwards , in the last word , the first word .
when i heard that , i thought that was creepy -- that & apos ; s exactly what my creative process is done .
this is not like my creative process -- i & apos ; m not like the channel !
i & apos ; m a < unk > . to work , i need to stand up every day at the same time and < unk > , i & apos ; m really uncomfortable at the same time .
but even i < unk > in the day , sometimes this thing < unk > .
and i guess a lot of you have done it too .
even i had worked or ideas that come from a source that i can & apos ; t really identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we step into that and not have it lost our minds , but to keep ourselves at the opposite of sound ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this is to create the musician tom < unk > , so i could interview him a magazine for a magazine a couple of years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? for most of his life , tom & apos ; s life was the embodiment of < unk > modern artist , who tried to < unk > those < unk > creative impulses that lived inside him and with them .
but he got older and quiet . he told me that one day he went to los angeles in los angeles , and everything changed for him .
he went at high speed when he suddenly heard a little face of a melody that & apos ; s like it & apos ; s often < unk > for him . and he wants to make it . it & apos ; s < unk > . he & apos ; s < unk > , but he can & apos ; t make it out .
he doesn & apos ; t have a piece of paper ; he doesn & apos ; t have a pen , he doesn & apos ; t have any < unk > .
so he starts to lose these old < unk > in it , such as , i & apos ; m going to lose this thing , and i & apos ; m going to be followed by this song forever .
i & apos ; m not good enough ; i can & apos ; t make it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
he finished the whole < unk > thing , and he did a whole new thing .
he looked like the sky , and he said , & quot ; excuse me , can & apos ; t you see that i & apos ; m going to drive a car ? & quot ;
< unk > , i look like i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a really extraordinary moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don & apos ; t , somebody else does .
go and down < unk > design for example .
the whole < unk > industry has changed after that .
not for the work itself . it & apos ; s still as much as it used to work as it used to .
but the process and the heavy < unk > that surrounds it was no matter when he took the genius out of him , where he wasn & apos ; t doing anything but he was < unk > and he was < unk > where he sort of came from . he realized it didn & apos ; t a < unk > thing .
there could be a kind of a < unk > , right , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the < unk > , < unk > stuff that wasn & apos ; t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed the way i worked , and it saved me pretty much once .
this idea saved me when i was < unk > in the middle of the book by < unk > < unk > , < unk > , love being < unk > . i fell into one of these < unk > of the < unk > that we all fall in when we & apos ; re doing something rather than i & apos ; m thinking .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i was just supposed to put this project together .
but then i remembered how tom talked to the sky in heaven , and i tried .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i started talking my comment on the side of a empty corner of the room .
i was talking out loud , you know , you & apos ; re listening to this thing , and i & apos ; m both sure if this book isn & apos ; t that it & apos ; s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i have everything i have , i & apos ; m happy . i & apos ; m not doing that anymore .
so if you want to do better , you & apos ; ve got to pop up here and cover your percentage of the deal .
okay . but if you don & apos ; t do this -- you know what , then the devil .
i & apos ; m gon na keep writing , because that & apos ; s my job .
and i & apos ; d like to propose that i & apos ; ve been here today for my part of the job .
because ... at the end of the day , it & apos ; s like this : < unk > in the deserts , < unk > people to < unk > with sacred dance and music that have been < unk > for hours , until dawn .
those fixed were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but go back and again , very rare , something special . one of the actors actually became < unk > .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you & apos ; ve seen in your life once like this .
it was a time that time < unk > and the dancers of a kind of a < unk > , and he did nothing but he & apos ; d never done it before -- 1,000 nights before . but everything was put together .
and all of a sudden , he couldn & apos ; t get into it any longer .
it & apos ; s been moved from the inside , and it & apos ; s taken up , and it & apos ; s all through a < unk > fire .
when this happened , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put hands together , and they started singing , < unk > < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , god , god , god , < unk > .
that & apos ; s god , you know ?
interesting historical & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; , when the < unk > < unk > agree , they took this practice . it changed < unk > in the course of the centuries of < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > < unk > .
when a mass in spain did something quite < unk > , something magical : < unk > < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , great < unk > < unk > , it & apos ; s : a < unk > god .
and that & apos ; s great , because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer himself wake up , and realize that it & apos ; s 11 o & apos ; clock at a tuesday -- and he & apos ; s no longer wearing an < unk > of god .
he & apos ; s merely a < unk > < unk > with < unk > knees , and maybe he & apos ; ll never get to be able to rise to those heights .
and perhaps not again , somebody & apos ; s name will say , & quot ; if he turns on it , but what & apos ; s he going to do with the rest of his life ? & quot ;
that & apos ; s hard .
that & apos ; s one of the < unk > need of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn & apos ; t have to be all that < unk > if you didn & apos ; t believe in the very first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from you .
if you just believe that you & apos ; re a loan -- from an < unk > source for an < unk > period of your life that & apos ; s passed on to someone else if you & apos ; re done with it .
when we start thinking about that , everything changes .
so i started thinking , and so i think of safety in the last few months , while i worked on this book , that will happen soon -- when the dangerous , < unk > , < unk > success of my life .
what i have to tell myself is , if i get crazy about this , it & apos ; s not a fear .
don & apos ; t be < unk > .
do your job simply .
be aware of your contribution as well as it may be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius that you & apos ; re asking for , for a brief moment , to show a similar moment from your effort , then < unk > < unk > ! < unk > !
and if not , dance still dance your dance .
and < unk > < unk > ! < unk > for you in spite of this .
i believe in this , and i feel like we should be teaching this .
< unk > < unk > ! < unk > for you , just for you to understand that you have just the mere human love and the < unk > of being there .
thank you .
thank you .
< unk > !
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic sea floor that < unk > for nearly three million years had the size of the lower 48 population .
but it doesn & apos ; t press enough that seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn & apos ; t show the thick of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic sea ice is the beating heart of our global < unk > .
it grows in the winter , and it & apos ; s growing in summer .
so the next slide i & apos ; m going to show you is a over the last 25 years , which has happened .
the waste systems have been marks in red .
and as you can see , it grows on the < unk > . this is the annual ice in the winter , and it & apos ; s in summer .
this so-called < unk > , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which comes from the body here .
in 25 years it & apos ; s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem because warming takes on the frozen reason around the arctic ocean in which there & apos ; s huge amounts of carbon in the ocean , which is when it & apos ; s < unk > by microbes .
compared to the whole < unk > amount of information in the atmosphere , that would double if we pass that critical point .
already today , < unk > in some flat lakes in alaska can be made of themselves from the water .
professor < unk > college in alaska is one with another class at a different university in the last winter .
wow !
you & apos ; re doing it well . the question is , how are you going to fix it ?
and one reason is this tremendous amount of greenland than the north .
this is a < unk > < unk > .
but volume are far bigger than before .
this is the southwest river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know what the oceans is like by sea level rise here , it & apos ; s going to grow into the sea .
it & apos ; s going to catch these rivers very quickly .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest planet on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent now has a negative < unk > .
and the < unk > that & apos ; s taken place across a few < unk > is especially strong on melt .
that & apos ; s 20 feet across , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the < unk > < unk > , you & apos ; ll see new lakes on top that were a couple of years ago .
forty percent of the world & apos ; s population get half the value of their genome project .
in the anyway , this glacier is the most < unk > for this town .
the everybody & apos ; s day they turned themselves on .
but if it < unk > , it will also < unk > most of the drinking water .
it was seen in california a < unk > reduction in sierra < unk > .
this is the < unk > .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
this kind of thinking in the whole world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters around the world inside a really big box , and it & apos ; s unprecedented , and it & apos ; s never happened before .
so many , in the last 30 years , like the people who are 75 .
this is a completely < unk > photograph .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons a day in the oceans .
look closely at the domain of the eastern pacific ocean , from the american continent and < unk > of the indian , where there is a huge decline in the ocean in the ocean .
most of the individual factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the result of the biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest oil companies , together with china .
and the suggestion was to build many , many further < unk > .
but we & apos ; re starting to see change .
here are the ones that are taken out in the last few years with some green alternatives that were being proposed .
there & apos ; s a political conversation in our country .
and < unk > and < unk > have spent $ < unk > last , trying to get clean coal , which is a contradiction that & apos ; s already a contradiction .
this image reminded me of something .
for christmas day , i got home in tennessee , a billion tons of < unk > .
you & apos ; ve seen it < unk > in the news .
this is in our whole country of america & apos ; s < unk > all over america .
this was happening around christmas .
one of the commercials in the < unk > around christmas was this one .
< unk > < unk > is a happy , happy fellow .
there & apos ; s him in skin and america , and he & apos ; s helping to grow our economy .
< unk > , the < unk > is getting clean up every day .
he & apos ; s affordable , he & apos ; s < unk > , and he & apos ; s in < unk > and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful answer is the director of < unk > < unk > .
let me be clear . al gore , nancy < unk > , harry < unk > , harry < unk > , they don & apos ; t know what they & apos ; re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection was calling for two campaigns .
this is one , part of it .
in the southern hemisphere , we see climate change as a serious risk for our business .
that & apos ; s why we set the top < unk > to spend some significant < unk > spend to get a < unk > on the way to get the truth out of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it & apos ; s clean -- and it smells even more good .
so , don & apos ; t worry about the climate change .
let & apos ; s leave that quiet .
< unk > coal , you & apos ; ve heard a lot about it .
so let & apos ; s go for a tour of this modern , clean < unk > .
fantastic ! this machine & apos ; s pretty loud .
but it & apos ; s the sound of the clean energy future .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main warming for global warming that & apos ; s absolutely remarkable , that you see here , changes everything .
take a look at that in fact , this is today , clean energy production .
finally , the positive alternative came together with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that ties that all this together is our addiction of < unk > energy like dirty coal and coal .
but now there & apos ; s a courageous , new solution to get us out of that thinking .
< unk > america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
to get america back to work , to make us safer and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that & apos ; s big enough to solve our problems .
< unk > america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it & apos ; s about a < unk > of america .
so one of the world & apos ; s fastest , our addiction of old , dirty < unk > , to < unk > our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment in order to get paid good jobs .
< unk > america . it is time to accept reality .
there & apos ; s an old african adage : & quot ; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to get far away , go . & quot ;
we have to get far , quick .
thank you .
i & apos ; d like to start asking you to go back to the time of your childhood , when you were playing with these < unk > .
while they realized how to pick up hands and < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , and , in fact , they learned how to understand and solve problems by understanding and change < unk > context .
spatial thinking is closely associated with understanding how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- along with my < unk > < unk > and my colleague , i began to wonder : what if we could use computers and < unk > to make an < unk > ...
that & apos ; s a question we & apos ; ve decided to explore the answer and to < unk > .
in short , a matter of fact , an interactive computer is the size of a computer .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can capture your movements , and you have a screen , and you have an < unk > .
more importantly , are physically , so why you can & apos ; t just cross them with your hands and move them around .
and the < unk > are an example of a new generation of different < unk > to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools become physical and conscious minds to their movements , recognize each other and to perceive the world & apos ; s surface with them , we can begin to explore new < unk > .
i & apos ; m going to start with some simple examples .
this heat map is for the < unk > < unk > , and when i push it towards one direction , the video is played forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it & apos ; s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other true .
so if i put them side-by-side , that & apos ; s what you & apos ; re interested in .
if you & apos ; re < unk > around , you & apos ; ll notice that and you can get a little nervous .
and they also feel their movements and their might .
so an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to see was that we could apply everyday gestures to data about how colors you & apos ; re doing , how you & apos ; re doing it with when you & apos ; re doing it .
in this case , we have three < unk > as the < unk > , and i can use them for < unk > color in the middle , where they & apos ; re being mixed .
if you don & apos ; t play it , you know , we can < unk > it a little bit .
also , there are some nice ways in education like languages , math , math , < unk > , where we are going to give people the opportunity to do the quick < unk > and see the results immediately .
here i am -- that & apos ; s a fibonacci series that i end up with a simple < unk > .
this is a game with words which is a kind of mixture of < unk > and < unk > .
basically , you get all the way out on each < unk > randomly chosen letter , and while you & apos ; re trying to figure out words , these are going to be tested over a dictionary .
then , at about 30 seconds , you & apos ; re < unk > , and you & apos ; ve got a new < unk > and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab ; i could get them to try and try it and bring a video .
they really loved it .
one of the interesting things about this kind of applications is that you don & apos ; t need to give people many instructions .
all you need to say is & quot ; form words , & quot ; and they know exactly what to do .
let me show you some people that test this .
that & apos ; s our youngest < unk > right there .
it turned out he just wanted to actually stack them up .
so for him , they were just < unk > .
this is an interactive software company .
we wanted to develop a lighting system for war victims .
this is < unk > .
he & apos ; s able to bring new characters into the scene by showing off the table of the table that he & apos ; s putting out this character .
here he & apos ; s going to be walking the sun .
the sun is going on .
now he & apos ; s getting a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the < unk > shake , and side by side , he can play the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it & apos ; s a story that & apos ; s < unk > , and it can decide how it & apos ; s going to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example i & apos ; ve been doing recently is to show a kind of a < unk > system that we & apos ; ve developed recently , and where we & apos ; re doing things like < unk > , < unk > and < unk > .
every four different variations ; you can choose which way you want to use .
and you can put sound into the sequence that you can turn in any pattern of patterns .
and they & apos ; re just < unk > them by holding a < unk > of a < unk > .
there are effects that can be changed live , like hall and filters .
you put it in one particular tone , and you later put it together .
and then even more of the effects of speed and volume that you & apos ; re doing on the whole sequence .
so let & apos ; s see .
we & apos ; re starting to extend the voice into two < unk > < unk > and those in a row , and they & apos ; re growing it up and adding some of the voice a little bit more .
so i & apos ; m going to add a bass .
now i & apos ; m going to do some drums .
and i & apos ; m now pulling the filter with the drums so that i can steer the live effect .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by < unk > the pace into one direction or another .
and i & apos ; m just going to just hook up the filter ; there & apos ; s some more expression .
i can bring the sequence through them .
and by doing so , i don & apos ; t have to plan them in a < unk > way ; they & apos ; re going to be going out and help ; they & apos ; re going to < unk > or < unk > .
and finally , i can < unk > the whole sequence by running out of the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire to develop new < unk > that would work better on how our brains and bodies work .
and i & apos ; ve had time now to show you part of this new machine , and some of the ways of showing what we & apos ; re working on in our lab .
the idea that i & apos ; d like to leave you with now is that we & apos ; re on the threshold of this new generation of energy to interaction with digital media to the information that & apos ; s in our world , which is our need .
thank you .
and i & apos ; m happy talking to all of you .
yeah , good afternoon .
happy to find out that i & apos ; m there .
so , what & apos ; s supposed to be ?
i have to step back a little bit , and that & apos ; s what & apos ; s going on in there with modern molecular biology .
i & apos ; ve been studying molecular biology , and i & apos ; ve been doing that for a couple of years now , and i & apos ; ve started this because i just wanted to know very well , and i & apos ; ve wanted to do it myself , which i & apos ; ve theoretically .
so , this was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like that .
i think that the molecular biology , generally speaking , biotechnology , biotechnology , everything that matters to synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is , already extremely important , and much more important will be important in the future .
it & apos ; s a lot of < unk > < unk > plants to the plants that we have .
there are craig venter now in the < unk > , who & apos ; s now trying to make < unk > , or < unk > from algae .
there & apos ; s also some stuff that & apos ; s gone in the everyday , which most people don & apos ; t even realize , like < unk > , that allow us to wash away with 40 degrees of change , are also < unk > enzymes .
and the list is capable of continue on and on .
and so from there i & apos ; m further about this technology , and i & apos ; m just further around .
so why now is < unk > ?
most people know this , most of the people know this from the < unk > .
computers showed up , and then it becomes like all the time in the media , and the hackers break down somewhere somewhere and claws and so on .
now , that & apos ; s kind of sad , because that & apos ; s not what it & apos ; s actually beginning and what & apos ; s actually behind it .
in fact , in the & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; , in the & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; , they started < unk > , and also from that , the internet came out .
and it & apos ; s about getting creative , original , original way of solving a problem .
and the problem it & apos ; s not just a technical issue , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a < unk > thing , so what it means to make any < unk > problem , and how you make it different or make it better .
and it & apos ; s just been established with software , but there & apos ; s also in the < unk > , there & apos ; s an entire way of doing it , and there & apos ; s a whole < unk > thing that & apos ; s going on with < unk > making < unk > < unk > < unk > all kinds of < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > .
and now there & apos ; s also a way towards biology , and there & apos ; s this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a < unk > , because the < unk > code is , it & apos ; s not just a foreign code , it & apos ; s not just like computer .
but it & apos ; s also a code , and it & apos ; s something that you can program , and that & apos ; s also what i found , and that & apos ; s amazing to me , and that & apos ; s where i just wanted to get a lot of deep .
it actually didn & apos ; t even mean eight really thought of this , these networks .
there & apos ; s < unk > source , which is originally from switzerland , this is with europe and with a cooperation within india , < unk > network , but by now , members or active people in the world .
these are a little more artistic orientation , so there are a lot of artists and philosophers , and working with scientists , just working with these technologies and asking them to work and process that , because there are creative , and so , you know , possible .
but it & apos ; s really all about finding such a price of access , such a playful access to it .
and then there & apos ; s the < unk > went through , < unk > .
this is a network which is actually a network that & apos ; s kind of forum where you & apos ; re going off and talking online .
they & apos ; re a little bit set of technical , and there & apos ; s also a little bit of < unk > on the other hand , and they & apos ; re asked , you know , < unk > questions .
and based on these networks that have made the whole popular thing , it & apos ; s just a scene that i & apos ; d like to share with you so quickly .
here in the image on the left is < unk > , so it & apos ; s a high school , basically a kind of school , a private school , nonprofit club , where everybody can get the institution .
kids , old ones , all sorts of people go there , just to set them up , have set up a laboratory and look at what you can do when these guys are going up .
here on the bottom left is a group in indonesia , called < unk > , which is there for quite a long time .
it & apos ; s been a longer than these other networks .
it also acts like this in an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , < unk > , and combining it in a quite < unk > way .
it & apos ; s a group that i met a little while ago , and they & apos ; ve got a < unk > system that likes to give more to the public , which is what they & apos ; re learning in school , and they & apos ; ve been doing so on < unk > to explain , and explain , little people to explain .
and i have up above in the other image a lecture in copenhagen medical museum in a combination of an exhibition in a < unk > museum .
and that , yes , that & apos ; s usually very young people , but the only thing that got us together is this amazing thing about technology .
and what you can do with this , and to start paying attention to society and ask questions like , & quot ; okay , what do you know what you want to do , do you want to join the interest that you & apos ; re doing with this ? & quot ;
so , okay , now to make biology a little bit of material , you need some sort of material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and that & apos ; s a lab .
or , what you normally understand in a lab , which is kind of < unk > machines , extremely expensive , extremely < unk > , only for < unk > , trained academics , and so on .
and our approach was really time to say , okay , you don & apos ; t actually have to do it .
it & apos ; s not necessary , actually , because each < unk > technology has really evolved much higher technology than most < unk > , it & apos ; s the case .
and it & apos ; s o < unk > with that premise , for example , brian < unk > in england has tried to do with it , has taken a < unk > , a < unk > and , a < unk > , has worked with it , and then bacteria .
so everyone who & apos ; s been through a soup that they & apos ; ve been left for too long now has been made .
i did it in my lab , trying to expand a little bit , and then i bought < unk > on ebay and make some < unk > analysis , try to make a < unk > , so it & apos ; s the same way that we & apos ; re doing .
this isn & apos ; t supposed to be a joke , actually .
down here you see the project , in < unk > , so there & apos ; s a < unk > garage with everything that the university has < unk > , a group in paris , and that & apos ; s very interesting .
and this is < unk > < unk > , who actually mentioned < unk > , this yeah , sort of a < unk > for molecular biology .
and yeah , so , you see , it & apos ; s relatively < unk > , so that & apos ; s very important for people to do this at home , until the big organizations that < unk > more , as well .
but just as always the approach , it & apos ; s supposed to be simple and accessible .
the first project that we & apos ; ve done as an international group , when we & apos ; re sort of aware of ourselves , okay , we & apos ; re now as a real scene , and we & apos ; re online , and we & apos ; re familiar with the people that are kind of people out there and how it is .
and then , just from the < unk > < unk > < unk > website , and he said , & quot ; well , we & apos ; re going to have to meet in the real world , & quot ; and they & apos ; re actually organized two things in london , < unk > and < unk > , in san francisco .
and then it was about , yes , who are we , what would we want , what would we want to share with us ?
and what are our values and what are our perhaps what is our others , our foundation ?
and that & apos ; s where we & apos ; ve actually worked out that way .
that was quite intuitive , so everyone just has the wishes , his , his , what & apos ; s moving , he & apos ; s saying .
there , i think , a whole good code set up there .
and we didn & apos ; t make that one up , but that & apos ; s what i think has been doing pretty well , that people are quite convinced of this .
and we even then tried to get back in the academic world , but there somehow is not like that .
so i think we & apos ; re from < unk > , in fact , a step further than even the academic world .
so , what projects are we actually doing now ?
a project i did with the < unk > in switzerland myself was that we wanted to build an optical case called optical fall or optical < unk > .
that & apos ; s when you focus a laser , focus on a room , then you can capture little particles in the air , or if you & apos ; re in the liquid and then get that focus , that & apos ; s captured there , like a < unk > in the room .
this is really working , this is done in academic technology , and then we thought , well , we might get the wars , we & apos ; ve taken on a webcam , the < unk > , the lens < unk > , < unk > , and then you & apos ; re < unk > a microscope .
that & apos ; s down there .
and then we have a < unk > < unk > < unk > and < unk > the laser , and then we try to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn & apos ; t work , but we & apos ; ve learned a lot about it .
here & apos ; s another project that came from the french group in paris , and that & apos ; s kind of cool .
in fact , he & apos ; s just a < unk > , a < unk > , something like that , so he & apos ; s been looking at a < unk > , his < unk > is sam < unk > .
and he then turned out to have built this helmet , and in the cooperation , this is the place that we took .
and then the visitors people in the room could go in this room , sit on this chair , sit on this helmet .
and then they measured their < unk > , and depending on what they thought they had thought or how they thought , then there are different lights in the room .
it was a project that was quite < unk > project .
another thing that & apos ; s in the united states that has to do with this information company , which is the < unk > , which is the < unk > , complicated word .
so it & apos ; s about < unk > genes , < unk > , < unk > , fragments so that you can make them visible .
so now , if i do that the < unk > on the scene of the crime , then there are some < unk > , and then they turn this technique forward , and they can say , & quot ; hey , this hair belongs to this human . & quot ;
and the machines that do this , which are very expensive , which you buy , that are going on at < unk > dollars .
and that isn & apos ; t very much in the design business , but it & apos ; s a really cool technology that & apos ; s really good at the same amount of technology .
so that & apos ; s just one application of many that we can do with this .
and the people that were so two argument in the world , and they said , & quot ; well , we & apos ; re getting easier and cheaper , & quot ; and then we & apos ; ve got open source , so open source , hardware , this machine , and that & apos ; s even the < unk > .
i think that & apos ; s somehow < unk > dollars or something .
but anyway , it & apos ; s still not cheap , but it & apos ; s certainly in a frame where it & apos ; s becoming obvious .
so it & apos ; s , in my opinion , a very complicated < unk > .
one project that i had just started building was a research project .
< unk > is , yeah , it & apos ; s a kind of < unk > that & apos ; s about that far away , two centimeters or something like that .
you invites < unk > to < unk > and then < unk > it into these < unk > , and then i & apos ; ve shot them on house and then light them up , and i & apos ; ve put them on the light like that .
so the device that you see is not working .
but this is my prototype , which was pretty < unk > , so on a branch that & apos ; s attached to electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure was too high , that was broken .
and then i took a < unk > , and i put it in there .
a < unk > , if you do the full of power with water , well the pressure , so i think that & apos ; s about 40 to 40 times as much bar .
and then you can accelerate the particles so that the particles go up very fast , and then the ones that fit in .
and commercial device costs something like < unk > euro or something , to get around 50 .
so it doesn & apos ; t have the same efficiency , but it & apos ; s basically fair .
and that & apos ; s what it & apos ; s like at the moment that & apos ; s the scene of the scene to really increase this availability , and also to increase the information , and having the idea that more people can get engaged in this way .
because , as the beginning said , it & apos ; s an extremely important technology , and most people have a relatively little idea about it , and also no chance to form really well .
because , if you read about it , from < unk > , that & apos ; s not the same thing once you & apos ; ve done it yourself or seen .
and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you can also want to be a meaningful citizen in society and want to be able to join , then you need access to knowledge and to technology .
and you have to do it , and you have to understand it and understand it .
and then we & apos ; re running out of < unk > open ocean science and citizen science .
so , just as citizens , you & apos ; ll be able to engage yourself with this scientific technology .
and that & apos ; s the < unk > of the < unk > < unk > .
these are the people who dressed at least officially end up on the website , < unk > website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what & apos ; s also interesting is that they & apos ; re also represented in southeast asia .
this is me think there are fewer people there who are than actually exist .
so i know some of you who haven & apos ; t sat down .
and these are just the < unk > , the individual people .
some of the time with these < unk > , which means we put these places together .
and that & apos ; s very much at the beginning .
it started , like i said , < unk > .
and < unk > , so the < unk > , because the main character in berlin was the first to < unk > .
and that & apos ; s now a gigantic network of very good , yeah , < unk > , which are represented all over the world .
and we hope , of course , we & apos ; re going to < unk > ourselves very well , and then we & apos ; re also extremely well connected so that there & apos ; s more people to it .
and i & apos ; d invite each time to explore with this , and take a look at what it is to try .
it & apos ; s not that easy now , but it & apos ; s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you & apos ; re kind of < unk > .
so thanks for listening .
that was it .
yeah , hello .
how do we really work ?
that & apos ; s a question that < unk > me as a designer , but also in the field of < unk > and in front of all the things i & apos ; m talking about in the user .
it & apos ; s about how people walk through interactive media in your interactive media to use these interactive media and creating it as a matter of < unk > experiences .
because i believe that the interactive media in < unk > us , cognitive models , so paradigm that , in our biological memory , have been managed very , very long time and that we can bring back the media just by interactive media .
and that & apos ; s very amazing , because you actually think that these < unk > you & apos ; re going to meet , which is actually bringing you into the future , but in fact , it & apos ; s like the future that & apos ; s right for us , in our way of life .
now , what are < unk > models ?
i & apos ; ve got four < unk > store , and i & apos ; d just like to quickly explain .
now , in < unk > cognitive models , these are the models that we put into the traditional times .
these mental models that we have heard that we have , basically , natural ratio for virtuality .
that sounds unusual , basically .
i & apos ; m going to take that right now , and i & apos ; m going to show you that they have a natural relationship with virtuality .
the second piece is that since this funny models , we & apos ; ve been able to speak very , even though today , we & apos ; re using a more sophisticated language .
and the third area , which basically < unk > itself .
we all know that the interactive media is < unk > by definition , which includes the denial of death , and of course tells us that we feel the most normal feeling today is normal .
the fourth thing is that the story for us is a place of < unk > .
now , what about virtuality with virtuality that & apos ; s really the most natural thing about the world .
i want to prove that for you .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we & apos ; re not going to be able to answer them immediately , but it & apos ; s going to happen , and it & apos ; s happening right now .
you go in the mind through this house , you live in live houses , and you look at how many doors there are .
and that & apos ; s what they & apos ; re doing .
they < unk > the reality and < unk > with no computers .
great , isn & apos ; t it ?
and so , for example , we & apos ; re looking at < unk > , like putting virtual reality in our < unk > , we can actually do it all over time .
and this wealth of money that you have , you know , the virtual reality that people had in the traditional times required , because they didn & apos ; t have anything to do .
they had no books .
or they had no < unk > .
they had no mass media .
the only thing they had was their heads .
and in this mind , memory took off .
in that head , knowledge became knowledge < unk > and using this virtual images , the imagination , has been passed away from knowledge as well .
and that & apos ; s why we & apos ; re rooted in a lot that we can deal with the virtuality so well .
the interesting thing is , once i get to make a little field trip .
yeah , it can do .
what & apos ; s interesting about this is that at the time , the human being was simultaneously < unk > and medium himself .
now , if you just think a little bit further , please .
what are media today ?
and then you & apos ; ll notice that there & apos ; s a change .
but i & apos ; ll get to that in a minute .
commercial tools that came < unk > have been vital for stories .
the < unk > , the priest , the < unk > , were < unk > to keep knowledge in stories .
and so today , we & apos ; re still very , very strong with stories .
the author of the book , the < unk > < unk > , jonathan < unk > , we & apos ; re still < unk > every year with the < unk > hours of stories .
this means for a child who has been spending most of the time in his life with the stories of stories of stories .
now we think our love for stories depends on the fact that we & apos ; ve been on our parents & apos ; lap .
no , no , go a long way .
this goes a lot further back to cultures & apos ; s cultures .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as a particularly impressive world , that we & apos ; ve < unk > experiences in our biological memory , to think of the ability to think about < unk > .
i brought with you an example of the families in a < unk > stem cell .
and life lived in the british columbia of british columbia .
and as you can see , it & apos ; s a very complicated area , and you had to navigate , kind of , from island to island to get to produce food .
and they did that by so-called < unk > .
you may also know that , if you & apos ; re interested in doing this a little bit , from the australian < unk > .
they have similar principles .
they don & apos ; t have any < unk > , but they & apos ; ve used < unk > < unk > or < unk > .
and what & apos ; s interesting about this is the cycle and the topography of regions could be mapped from songs to songs .
whereas the language of mind was different from the language of language .
so , you & apos ; re talking about < unk > sounds and about rhythm .
and these sounds and these rhythm have shown the geology of a region , and that has , of course , allowed you to < unk > these songs and move different from the left , to the right , and also to move back to the < unk > .
why don & apos ; t we sing any more to get from top to point a to b ?
so anyway , not to navigate .
so , what & apos ; s actually happened ?
this is what & apos ; s happened so < unk > machine .
we moved on in what & apos ; s called < unk > < unk > .
what happened is the age of machine , and it & apos ; s the book age , and it & apos ; s actually the first time it & apos ; s the < unk > .
and that is exactly what we are asking for our memories and the production of our individual memories change in the external media .
and on the book . and on .
so , unfortunately , we have a little bit of < unk > to < unk > .
virtuality has become alien to ourselves , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous < unk > at the < unk > , has been so far to say that these mass media , he says the book , and the image , not television , the internet and so on and so on , what we now call mass media and < unk > .
let & apos ; s make a little < unk > .
from the < unk > to the machine age .
what & apos ; s driving on our thinking and our thinking ?
then the < unk > < unk > are part of the original cultures .
and these , over the years , have become more and more < unk > by < unk > of < unk > .
this is , instead of remembering us , we & apos ; ve been increasing , far more common , masses of memories of memories that we & apos ; re able to hang our personal memories on .
we no longer produce ourselves .
we have a abstract < unk > language .
we don & apos ; t think of the thing in any more in pictures , the things that are going on in pictures , but we & apos ; re kind of < unk > them our language .
we & apos ; ve become very used to things happening linear .
and we accepted the equipment as a law , and there are only exceptions , like the < unk > < unk > .
what & apos ; s left us is the < unk > .
still , we & apos ; re very < unk > , very much arrested .
the question is , what & apos ; s next ?
we had the < unk > system , we had the machine age , and we are now going on what & apos ; s called a < unk > .
it sounds like a whole < unk > thing , and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the < unk > that bring us this opportunity to again discover our skills back .
this is about virtuality , it & apos ; s about < unk > , it & apos ; s about < unk > .
i want to explain a little bit quickly .
there are technical concepts , for example , that gives us reality , that & apos ; s called extended reality .
so if you look at google < unk > , for example , it & apos ; s such a concept that & apos ; s going to bring us the virtual world back to the real world , which is what we call < unk > < unk > , which is like something that & apos ; s ordinary , natural .
another example is something called virtual reality .
this is how crazy the context of my talk may sound , because we don & apos ; t move physically , virtual worlds , like the role of sleep .
and other examples are the < unk > , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to people .
all this requires the ability to accept our fundamental ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i hope in closing , and i hope the video works , a very , very nice project , this is the < unk > of michael < unk > , < unk > < unk > , < unk > < unk > and < unk > < unk > < unk > .
and the two < unk > are also here today .
maybe you can stand up for a second so you can pause with the two about the project .
and this is a project that i brought with as an example of how again is < unk > , cognitive models .
all of this is a game , i have to say about it .
which , of course , is extremely < unk > and it & apos ; s a computer game .
and if i say computer games , they & apos ; re very likely to have any people on their own , or they & apos ; re < unk > , or they & apos ; re playing with some kind of a < unk > that they & apos ; re in their hands .
anyway , they & apos ; re doing it .
this is a game outside .
and that is what i thought i would meet the outside world , so that i < unk > the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data on the < unk > that we produce with the real world .
i & apos ; m so sorry i & apos ; ve got to get a lot of < unk > .
and you & apos ; ll be able to explain so much better because there & apos ; s much more to it .
and that & apos ; s the idea that i & apos ; m studying a city by looking at places positive or negative .
and so i get it from the city to a very different view , a very different impression , which is i see negative and positive zones of a city and so on this way , a very different , very different , map of a real city .
and this is something we & apos ; re interested in seeing now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you & apos ; re about to see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is very clear .
and with some kind of ... we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i & apos ; d like to summarize this stuff in my mind , and that & apos ; s , in a sense , that the properties and the skills that we & apos ; ve taken from < unk > & apos ; s point of view are a little bit better than we can find in the < unk > complex < unk > of view .
thank you .
yeah , i & apos ; m very happy to be allowed to be with them .
i & apos ; ve been asked to see if this bag is a bag of bag that i & apos ; m talking about , and i & apos ; m going to talk about .
it & apos ; s not going to do that .
i & apos ; m going to come back to whatever it is that & apos ; s in there .
but so far , i & apos ; m kind of < unk > it a little bit .
yeah , children are naturally curious about nature , or be curious , designers .
i & apos ; m a < unk > from house , so , of course , i & apos ; m also concerned about the subject of curiosity and how the curiosity also changes , and why we might lose curiosity and < unk > , and so on and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you & apos ; re looking at next to , which is actually < unk > .
if professors are curious , they & apos ; re often < unk > in this n < unk > .
and that & apos ; s also what i had in the last half a year .
so it & apos ; s a bring to the subject of natural interface , or design interface .
now , you & apos ; re going to ask the question of why the whole thing is going on with the natural , < unk > technology of communications , and so on and so on .
and i only think one of these little devices high , because things are getting more and more intuitive , more natural , more < unk > , and you have to watch what is , of course , for us , what & apos ; s more intuitive or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i & apos ; ve been looking at natural gas design , so the next generation of people in the relationship of the person & apos ; s relationship to how our computers , or how the computer is changing from digital ideas .
so i & apos ; ve been trying to get to when , of course , or intuitive .
maybe have to take a look behind it again .
why does that happen ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , right there , we & apos ; re going to move now from the third to the fourth < unk > or the < unk > .
so , from modern into the < unk > .
every society is < unk > by a < unk > .
at first , the < unk > through language .
that is , they found themselves that by talking a common language , they could communicate with each other , they moved into the same cave , they created cities , they created cities , they created villages , they created villages , and so on , < unk > , so to speak .
the < unk > was the language , a very natural thing , a very living thing .
also had to learn , so i don & apos ; t have an prediction in nature , but we & apos ; re learning to < unk > and , of course .
that has been < unk > by the ancient society , and the first form of abstraction .
that was an < unk > then , because , of course , the living language started < unk > in the form of writing , which means that what & apos ; s < unk > and alive , i start and i & apos ; m putting it in stone as well .
so depending on how i got around , and when i grow up , there & apos ; s , of course , a whole different coverage than if you have a life of yourself .
but < unk > then moved these < unk > to < unk > , when < unk > first .
and then came the next generation we & apos ; re actually still alive today .
it & apos ; s the pressure < unk > and < unk > script with < unk > and others .
at the time , it was the same time when the people were < unk > , < unk > and others said , are you amazing when the people start reading , then you want to join the later join us , and that & apos ; s , of course , < unk > .
and now we & apos ; re coming into the next generation , and the exciting thing , which is just a last few hundred years , and we & apos ; re really in that moment in this sort of period that we & apos ; re doing something like this .
it confused us , of course , because we & apos ; re looking at the one side of the new media , < unk > social media , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is what we think of as the old thinking , doesn & apos ; t say that in the < unk > world and no more kind of beef anymore , or other phenomena , i want to do this just by < unk > and by < unk > .
and these two worlds are taking place right now , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing is that if you look at this , this new society , these < unk > , very many mechanisms , principles and < unk > parts of the system .
now , not at a local level , but at a global level .
we have understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global one .
i don & apos ; t think if i & apos ; m living green and the neighbor thinks less organic , then it doesn & apos ; t work .
this means that local village has actually become a global village with the same principles , if of course , intuitive , but it & apos ; s also the total transparency .
so , as you knew in the village then , who did what happened in the village and when , which is what & apos ; s happening today , by this expansion of our < unk > < unk > to a global scale .
be it that we know globally , and we & apos ; re getting faster and faster and better .
well , this is how it used to happen before in the village .
now , i & apos ; ve been looking at this before , which means , what & apos ; s really natural for us , what kind of thing we might have , what & apos ; s going on , what & apos ; s going on , but instinctively , what & apos ; s going to make the difference ?
because quite often you get people , you know , you can & apos ; t make them < unk > so that anybody can use it .
so you have to deal with this , which means that , not just , it & apos ; s going to change that it & apos ; s different , but it & apos ; s going to be better .
and when , of course , it & apos ; s a bit intuitive and how can i make influence on this as a < unk > and make things so you & apos ; re an intuitive , if you & apos ; re fun , because then you & apos ; re fun and you & apos ; re just using .
and you & apos ; re kind of trying to deal with the theme of perception and < unk > .
and that & apos ; s also , of course , what you start looking and see and says , ok , i & apos ; m just looking inside the inner self .
and so , how & apos ; s it , actually , in this ?
so how do we work when we go there ?
and what does it mean , of course , and how do our channels of perception and how does this cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs used to say , you know , you & apos ; re going to < unk > < unk > to < unk > < unk > it out .
so one of the things that you really need to look at in detail is if i want to make something < unk > or intuitive , which is what it means in the core .
and you already see that you have a our seven senses that most of us think we & apos ; re only now , we & apos ; re even seven < unk > , there & apos ; s certainly come in the near future of the next eighth sense , eighth sense , as we & apos ; re even < unk > .
and to watch how we process information , how do we take information ?
to alone , what is information ?
information is every difference that is a difference .
many use the word , but don & apos ; t actually know what it & apos ; s then detail .
but i need to understand at the heart of this , when is information going to produce information , when is information , when from data and information , so that i know how later i can make things the most intuitive or , of course , < unk > .
and , of course , design takes influence on perception .
we see this when i make things , i can make them confusing , like i don & apos ; t know where i don & apos ; t know what & apos ; s salt and pepper , or i can make them sort of intuitive , by showing things .
so , very much natural , in a tank , but i & apos ; m looking at it directly , where there & apos ; s salt and pepper in there .
and if i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , he & apos ; ll go to the right places where something is going on .
and on the left , it just gave me intuitive access , and hopefully it & apos ; s not sugar in there , the salt in there would be < unk > .
but also our perception itself , how makes them feel about us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , even though that & apos ; s not the case , but it & apos ; s very large , and yet our perception changes , depending on what kind of things we & apos ; re doing .
anyone know what this is ?
on top of it .
and < unk > should work even more .
there you go , & quot ; i & apos ; m likely to glasses .
so it & apos ; s an n circle .
a second circle already starts to < unk > or quite a bit .
and when i hold another < unk > , suddenly we don & apos ; t see just one unit , that circle , and circle , but we see one entity , we don & apos ; t see three pieces , a circle , a circle , another circle , another .
it & apos ; s called < unk > , or < unk > , which , again , affects us in perception .
i think it & apos ; s very important for the < unk > that usually < unk > , the great < unk > .
near it , < unk > of the continuity of the continuity and so on .
so quite often in the third one , let & apos ; s forget .
but this is a essential important ingredient in order to make things very intuitive , in a way .
the next phenomenon , which is also really interesting , is in the world .
sounds pretty much at first , but it & apos ; s very exciting , if you & apos ; re closer to it .
so , we have the front , and now we think that we & apos ; re going to look backwards .
this is wrong .
they & apos ; re looking backwards from scratch to front .
that is , they create a assumption forward , that you see something that you can see , < unk > circle .
that is , we don & apos ; t know what we & apos ; re seeing before we see it , again , back into our < unk > , to say , okay .
i have made such & quot ; deep cognitive tools , you & apos ; ve got what you want to see . & quot ;
so that & apos ; s another one , and that & apos ; s coming back again .
and then again , it & apos ; s again on the front , because it doesn & apos ; t really tell us , now , going forward , and i & apos ; m sure you & apos ; re looking at what you see , that & apos ; s what you want to see .
and then again , it & apos ; s going to be in the back , and it & apos ; s actually seen it .
so it & apos ; s a very < unk > process of how certain things go and do things that make these things happen .
i don & apos ; t know who & apos ; s familiar with this picture .
same thing is happening in the same way that i described before .
now , each one of these patterns is trying to see .
i don & apos ; t know who sees it .
does someone see anything ?
a ted < unk > , right .
once i & apos ; ve seen that there & apos ; s a < unk > inside , you know this .
they & apos ; re never going to forget that , because i & apos ; m going to show you where < unk > is .
now look at the < unk > .
and on , now you see him .
that is , i & apos ; ve actually been < unk > them now to see that they don & apos ; t recognize patterns anymore , but i & apos ; ve got them < unk > within a very short period of time , over and over again to this dog in that dog .
and this is the needs of the global scale , < unk > , see .
now i know that and now i & apos ; m going to move forward , i & apos ; m going to look at the ted < unk > .
i see the < unk > .
now , very exciting processes that , in this one , yes , it isn & apos ; t really , but here in this < unk > mass just happened .
anybody know what three seconds is ?
long , yes .
this is our present time .
well , it & apos ; s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know it takes me three seconds , until i & apos ; m like , you know , in the present , i can & apos ; t do very well during the fact that i & apos ; m doing it by < unk > somebody at three seconds .
it only has to process that as the present .
and then it moves into the past , and so i & apos ; m able to get very elegant , for example , to get to the computer if i know this phenomenon .
what & apos ; s < unk > milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
and it & apos ; s also a very interesting phenomenon .
that & apos ; s the time when you fall in love .
that means give you break , if you know that now , you & apos ; ll pay attention to who you & apos ; ve been going to look like for a long time , because i don & apos ; t like < unk > < unk > for what & apos ; s going on there .
and < unk > milliseconds , even a very interesting phenomenon .
that & apos ; s the most perceptions that we have .
that means that this first impression is happening in a very fast way that we perceive things .
and we also see things on what we & apos ; re paying attention to , and how we & apos ; re going to sort of < unk > ourselves against the environment so that we can think about it .
of course , the < unk > doesn & apos ; t only deal with the subject of perceptions and neural < unk > or < unk > , but mostly with the subject of < unk > .
so it & apos ; s like a human being with certain things .
there & apos ; s actually < unk > , which is very practical , so that & apos ; s how < unk > things or < unk > aspects .
there & apos ; s < unk > , where i know exactly where i need to reach .
however , there & apos ; s symbolic functions , why is there somebody for such a small < unk > , where you can & apos ; t get any < unk > , the < unk > amount of money , even though it & apos ; s not so good ?
we & apos ; re more like < unk > , on the < unk > side , which we as a < unk > , of course .
now , back to my real natural interface and the theme , which , of course , is < unk > .
< unk > always means how quickly i can achieve a certain target , or how a person can achieve in a certain kind of < unk > effectively , efficient , efficient , efficient .
so that & apos ; s more the norm about it .
how can i go there and do something called < unk > ?
can i use that directly , or i need & # 91 ; n & # 93 ; , or i need any training to do that for that .
and less < unk > or < unk > it is .
i & apos ; m doing this differently , and doing beautiful doesn & apos ; t mean it & apos ; s better .
you have to understand this too .
and when you look in part of the software we just saw that , it & apos ; s going to understand why < unk > percent of our current software is intuitive or < unk > or not based on < unk > ; it & apos ; s a lot of < unk > software .
there & apos ; s no intuitive devices that apple & apos ; s been a very large < unk > , < unk > thing to do when i just use technological devices to harness people .
why ?
because usually we & apos ; ve gone through this new kind of user interface , so the natural user user user experience , for example , is five times faster than we & apos ; re on average .
now , you have to imagine that if you make something of the classical design process , you have to have five hours , and with this new kind of natural software only an hour .
that doesn & apos ; t mean that they & apos ; re likely to be allowed to go home four hours , but they & apos ; re like , & quot ; one , & quot ; if you & apos ; re going to work with the four hours .
but i want to say that it & apos ; s , of course , a breath for us is now to get certain things .
so if we go back to the area of the software , here & apos ; s the first < unk > interfaces that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next , which we & apos ; ve worked with & apos ; re now < unk > model or mental model like software , which is that you & apos ; ve had an idea of something that the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so , not more ones and ones , or < unk > codes , but a metaphor .
it & apos ; s made it a lot more fun , but , of course , it & apos ; s a lot better .
the next generation of technology workers & apos ; s next generation is working a lot more with behavior .
so that & apos ; s what i do as a < unk > very , very , very often , is what behavior look like .
and that & apos ; s an paradigm shift .
that , suddenly , i look forward to what the success of the success , is , the most important thing will be a cut .
and then when i & apos ; m going to take a step back into these natural interfaces , where i & apos ; m talking by language , by < unk > , by gesture , and not mouse and data to control things , i & apos ; m faster and more food .
but that also leads me back to the point when things get worse when ?
if you get more intuitive , and then again i have to paint my little friend here and see what that means , what does it mean when is truly intuitive ?
and that & apos ; s always intuitive for human beings to think of something intuitively , if i don & apos ; t need to think about it .
so he doesn & apos ; t like to think , but he & apos ; s just going to set himself up .
the less i think of it , the better it is .
and what does this mean for designers ?
that is , if we look at the fact that we & apos ; re using existing < unk > from one to another , for example , the metaphor , then i can afford that as a < unk > .
that is , i can just take this intuitive , human time to put software on software , and then make the software very < unk > .
so it & apos ; s a question , of course , what & apos ; s the most powerful < unk > that we humans and now i have to tell you .
this is something called a < unk > .
this is using each of us and < unk > , and it & apos ; s an acronym , it & apos ; s < unk > , it & apos ; s < unk > , it & apos ; s < unk > .
this is what everyone is doing all the time , but it & apos ; s doing it unconsciously and it & apos ; s kind of intuitive or partly instinctively .
the model is already on the womb , and it & apos ; s < unk > , so it & apos ; s working in the world with young and old , and it & apos ; s been used all the time without even knowing that this model is there .
< unk > < unk > itself becomes about 50 to 40 times each of us , so in their sleep , you found that it & apos ; s way less often < unk > than it is .
i can now show this mental illness , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , to a private sector .
and with this kind of transmission , very similar to the metaphor of the learning process , now , not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a < unk > , a < unk > one .
and this is on the higher grail of < unk > rather than the classic metaphor of a classic metaphor , which is the world & apos ; s defense system .
and now , when i put that in , for example , when i & apos ; m doing it in the < unk > < unk > , < unk > as choice , it & apos ; s big at me , i can look at it in detail , or even looking at it .
then i can carry this whole thing around .
i & apos ; m trying to do it with a < unk > .
yeah , everybody & apos ; s eaten pies .
< unk > : now i & apos ; m kind of < unk > the object , again , < unk > , < unk > .
i & apos ; ll get the whole < unk > industry , and i can say , just show me any chocolate , for example , with chocolate .
and suddenly , a interface that & apos ; s much more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can reach out to the bits , < unk > , and they come to me , a lot more natural than if you have < unk > organized websites or other mechanisms , it can make these things available to you .
imagination is more < unk > than < unk > < unk > , and with that note , i & apos ; d also like to close with , a and again to give you the clue , so designers have to think of different solutions , and in that sense , i & apos ; m right for your attention .
let me give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing , if you & apos ; re a child , as a baby , is that you take on what & apos ; s going to do , yes ? and the more you & apos ; ve allowed your parents to play more or less , you & apos ; re going to play more , quickly .
and curiosity doesn & apos ; t learn .
that & apos ; s why everybody who & apos ; s here and are curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can & apos ; t learn .
it & apos ; s about me now , basically this whole < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > in quality .
and there & apos ; s a central point to that .
and that depends on phosphorus .
< unk > < unk > a & apos ; s the opportunity .
they have two grams a day , each day , and they & apos ; re putting about two grams of phosphorus , and every one day they have to deliver two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they can & apos ; t have teeth .
they can not store energy .
they can & apos ; t have bone .
we could only act as a < unk > < unk > through the < unk > .
in fact , if we are not < unk > phosphorus and we are not < unk > .
and amazingly , it & apos ; s that we & apos ; re dealing with something that would actually be < unk > , but that & apos ; s not the case .
because everybody & apos ; s talking about energy , but nobody & apos ; s talking about < unk > .
the waste systems are much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we & apos ; ve only been phosphorus , and already in the world at a much more uranium in the environment than is used in all the < unk > .
in the last 20 years alone , < unk > tons of uranium have been distributed in the fields in germany .
and we & apos ; re taking it all up .
it makes leukemia to kids .
and we think we & apos ; d protect the environment if we & apos ; re a little less harmful .
so , for example , < unk > the environment , driving less car .
< unk > the environment , make less waste .
< unk > the environment , < unk > less energy .
but that & apos ; s not protection .
that & apos ; s the way i would say that , fix your child , it only takes three times as long .
that & apos ; s just a little less destruction .
if we think so from the < unk > to the < unk > , then our whole earth is going to be a < unk > , or later .
so it & apos ; s why we & apos ; re < unk > thinking .
and the most important thing is to look at the soil , as the first thing .
in the soil , < unk > percent of the earth is stored .
currently , we & apos ; re building corn , and we & apos ; re going to lose about 11 or 30 pounds of 30 pounds per hectare per hectare , or the square meter of corn .
that means we lose weight in the ground about five times more than new .
we can , of course , look at the < unk > .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in < unk > , are 20 percent of the world & apos ; s < unk > now .
and because we & apos ; re growing older , the 100 times the ever gets bigger .
so that & apos ; s pretty much everybody in the < unk > .
yeah ?
a baby needs about six hours of < unk > .
we could , of course , reduce that by 10 percent , but what is that doing ?
this is going to be done in china in a second .
that & apos ; s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these teacher ?
here & apos ; s one of the proof that men are not pigs , by the way .
will i tell you .
because the phosphorus is emitted in the pigs on the set of other things .
people are talking about the urine .
yeah .
so men can not be pigs .
because that & apos ; s what happened with it , isn & apos ; t it ?
traditionally we think in terms of knowledge , we & apos ; re too many around the world .
and if you were to these people who don & apos ; t have it , if you were any better , you wouldn & apos ; t be there , they will be < unk > and hostile .
and so someone tells us like al gore , one of our big heroes , there & apos ; s nothing but < unk > than to stabilize human population .
in israel , it & apos ; s when you give a human being , you kind of < unk > the earth .
here it says , the more you fall , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , you look at the weight of the ants on the earth , then the ants actually weigh about four times more than we are humans .
i could go with charity , but in the united states , no one likes forces , in that far , even though they & apos ; re a vegetarian .
that is , they weigh much more than we weigh .
and because they do , physically , work harder than we do , because they only live three to six months , they correspond to their weight in their weight , in their energy use a < unk > billion people .
that means we & apos ; re not too many , we & apos ; re too stupid , isn & apos ; t we ?
and where you see how far we & apos ; re going to go from what we really wanted , and how sad we are that we & apos ; re at all on planet , can you see that , for example , there & apos ; s a new program that & apos ; s < unk > here , right ?
you can only be secure if you don & apos ; t exist , yeah ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a < unk > tree ?
yeah ?
one ?
that is , our whole intelligence means we want to be much more than trees , right ?
yeah ?
no tree is < unk > .
luckily , not , yes ?
there & apos ; s no < unk > on trees .
there are still six billion trees in the < unk > alone .
you heard about it a little bit earlier , < unk > from trees ?
that is , all of our intelligence means we & apos ; re trying to be much more than trees .
and where you see , even in places like control , the world leaders & apos ; s < unk > agriculture , doesn & apos ; t allow our own < unk > to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus , which would have to go back in a real little loop .
and with that , we & apos ; re too many .
just about it .
that is why we feel so guilty about the world that we say . there is no < unk > , no < unk > , no < unk > , and how they all say we & apos ; re going to go back and forth our own brains .
isn & apos ; t that sad ?
we & apos ; re too many of these .
it makes sense to be less harmful in terms of information design .
but where are we useful ?
we & apos ; re trying to < unk > our ecological footprint , but the point is to have a large footprint that & apos ; s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest , is not there , right ?
< unk > , yes ?
they can only < unk > if they & apos ; re not there .
even now , if you shot , you would have emissions .
so they can & apos ; t do that at all .
we can change it differently .
we can our nutrients .
we & apos ; re in brazil agriculture , where we & apos ; re < unk > nutrients .
it & apos ; s right there , and we can < unk > nutrients in this kind of agriculture .
we & apos ; re doing this in china , for example , where we & apos ; re directly taking waste of it .
in china today , an < unk > is called < unk > , if you will , man . right ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
this means the whole western < unk > draw from the city of america has always taken away , but farmers & apos ; ve never stepped back .
and by doing so , cities would have to grow more and more , because the farmers in the cities , and the towns had to always move their nutrients further and further away .
because all the western rich people are increasingly expanding until they & apos ; ve not done the infrastructure , and then they & apos ; re < unk > .
yeah ?
in china it was different .
you & apos ; ve been able to get < unk > civilization over five years because you & apos ; ve always been able to get the nutrients back .
even today , if you & apos ; re invited to food , in china , you & apos ; re supposed to be expected to eat as long as it leaves the toilet .
because it & apos ; s < unk > to go and take the nutrients .
they & apos ; ve invited them to eat their food , not to eat it .
that means you can see them on the internet , how to get the nutrients back .
it & apos ; s actually fun in doing so , so agriculture creates head , create head of land in a country where so a farmer can make about < unk > dollars and the facility waiting for them to wait for chickens and chickens and vegetables and vegetables .
and the neat thing about it is the guys in the favelas goes back to the favelas by $ 100 percent .
so we don & apos ; t need to be the people control , the things that are bad .
we can support them to be good .
that & apos ; s natural gas , but the facilities are actually wearing themselves .
it & apos ; s clean water .
and they & apos ; re designed so , by design , which a farmer it can set you up .
so , this is what the < unk > are coming back .
and none of those sites , we & apos ; ve actually been building over < unk > , in the last 20 years , none of those facilities have ever been < unk > .
you could easily < unk > a liter of < unk > , and then it would < unk > the facility over years .
don & apos ; t it .
that is , we don & apos ; t need to be the people who are going to be < unk > bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to < unk > phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to get out of it , you & apos ; re going to write yourself up in germany , which is the best way to get out of all of those < unk > .
unfortunately , not in < unk > , but maybe you can help the < unk > with some help .
because the < unk > facility could best take away phosphorus .
and he has to get it back .
and we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it & apos ; s going to work .
we & apos ; ve spent three years in more than that .
the dutch government has explained that they & apos ; re going to be the world & apos ; s first country in terms of phosphorus .
but we need a total of them .
understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the population in the world .
there & apos ; s children & apos ; s a bunch of < unk > .
these are < unk > countries control 40 percent of < unk > .
and the oil is we & apos ; re going to replace with other energy .
but phosphorus is not going to replace phosphorus .
that & apos ; s not the idea of making existing a little less bad , but it & apos ; s about making things right .
and most of all , it & apos ; s to ask what the right thing to do .
that means it & apos ; s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in more , you understand this , of course , because in holland , it & apos ; s built on flowers .
yeah ?
imagine , for example , when your wife is sad , when you get your < unk > , and you get < unk > with 50 < unk > .
very inefficient .
but really , really effective , yes ?
or take a walk through .
a woman in germany eats about six < unk > kilograms during her lifetime .
there .
this isn & apos ; t scientifically right , because we don & apos ; t really know how much < unk > it is .
but if you have a lighting system , even for those lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but completely effective , right ?
so , one thing that & apos ; s beautiful about life is not efficient .
that & apos ; s why it & apos ; s not resources , it & apos ; s efficiency .
now , what & apos ; s the right thing to ask ?
not to burn the < unk > a little bit better , and by < unk > it and by < unk > down the whole materials for < unk > , but first with questions about how do you approach it ?
i want you to imagine mozart efficient .
yeah ?
when i put them at dinner and say , yes , there & apos ; s a pill with < unk > and a glass of water .
wonderful , & quot ; really ? & quot ;
it & apos ; s efficient .
everything that & apos ; s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , being efficient ?
yeah ?
that is , everything that counts in life doesn & apos ; t matter to save , is not to cut down .
whole < unk > thing .
we tell people , oh yeah . you & apos ; re not in the south .
no , it & apos ; s exactly the right thing to throw away ?
at any point where you take off , you know , you create again .
but the wrong thing .
if you put the wrong stuff up , you have an < unk > .
in the way that we think of north .
there & apos ; s every footprint on there .
if you walk , yes , everyone is breaking the ground .
because the soil is going to die down , and the wind , and the water is washing away the soil .
but if you are in italy , every footprint that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it & apos ; s about creating a big footprint that & apos ; s being < unk > .
don & apos ; t < unk > .
we & apos ; re saying in germany .
yeah ?
but if i ask you , how are you so familiar with your wife ?
so what do you say ?
sustainable .
and then i say , < unk > < unk > , right ?
that & apos ; s just the minimum amount .
so it & apos ; s not saving , it & apos ; s not saving .
every waste system is if there & apos ; s a waste of waste .
and it & apos ; s a lust when you see in italy , people in the high bow like this in the car , & apos ; < unk > out of the car .
because , you know , that & apos ; s an environmentally friendly process .
it & apos ; s & quot ; right form of < unk > , yeah ?
you can show me .
but with the right design , there we go .
we & apos ; ve created , for example , a < unk > that & apos ; s in room temperature , right ?
they can < unk > wherever they go and stand .
in two hours , it & apos ; s building everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that it < unk > its biodiversity to biodiversity .
so , we & apos ; re useful , not less harmful in this .
so there & apos ; s two cycles to make .
it & apos ; s not all to be natural .
a tv set or a washing machine , they don & apos ; t use it .
just the things that < unk > , like < unk > , like < unk > , like < unk > , who must be , they & apos ; re going to be in biological systems .
the things that are used just are going into technical systems .
but today we & apos ; re just talking about biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , in < unk > , right ?
it & apos ; s very direct product , not for the company of < unk > call , but it & apos ; s helping this company to succeed these products .
because we & apos ; re not doing things that are free .
yeah ?
now , if i put them on to eat and say , it & apos ; s free from < unk > , it helps them not to .
no , we hold on to what & apos ; s inside .
positive .
so it & apos ; s not like < unk > .
not toxic inside .
it & apos ; s all in it , it & apos ; s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can take on the < unk > at < unk > < unk > , and actually go to biological < unk > , right ?
everything is < unk > of it .
and if we get there , of course , we get to work for nike , for nike , for < unk > and < unk > and all the textile industry .
and that & apos ; s half of all the world & apos ; s < unk > , which are caused by the textile industry .
that & apos ; s why you help there , you ask people .
hey , < unk > , are you really serious ?
because they & apos ; ve already changed twice the business section .
and i & apos ; m not sure it & apos ; s going to be pretty much < unk > .
so , help me a little bit of that .
but it goes .
yeah .
this is what we & apos ; ve just been presented .
this is what you go .
we can make things like this if they fall out , if they come in a < unk > , they can < unk > you into biological < unk > .
technical cycles are the same .
there & apos ; s this direct act of information .
that & apos ; s the first environmental backpack , actually , that made it go back into the circulation .
and again , in every store you can < unk > things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the < unk > again ?
when it comes to waste right now .
we & apos ; re all these < unk > going around , almost .
in the countries where people get money .
so that < unk > up in the middle of the line , but really else in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics so it can go into biological systems , if we change the < unk > , inside it , that you can go back to < unk > , you can put them back to a baby in israel or in tunisia .
yeah ?
if you take those < unk > , you mix them , take the powder , put the powder to plants .
so this is the baby < unk > for the whole life , just from the very beginning .
so we don & apos ; t need to be < unk > , we can be < unk > .
it & apos ; s about a < unk > < unk > < unk > .
yeah , kind of like this .
yeah ?
this is something we can do .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started a institute on that .
there & apos ; s a lot of people there at this point , and they can all be engaged .
there & apos ; s extra an < unk > about where everybody can show up .
so , not saving more , not for saving , not for saving , but for intelligent waste .
are you going to make this curious ?
thank you .
it & apos ; s a work of < unk > .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , i speak that i consider myself a < unk > , a < unk > , so i understand it in the english language .
< unk > are the language of the written music in < unk > music .
you & apos ; ve got to understand as a language not just word for the text into a different language , but the deeper sense of words and < unk > need to understand it to make a meaningful translation , everyone who has to do with < unk > .
already from german english to english , there can be more knowledge , because it & apos ; s like when you & apos ; re doing poetry or poetry to make poetry .
it & apos ; s curious to see what we & apos ; re doing with our < unk > .
as a < unk > of a book designer , i first have the written music .
you & apos ; ll be sure that the composer in the grades has just < unk > everything that he & apos ; s seeing there .
in fact , the notes are very vague and < unk > .
these notes are roughly exactly the same or < unk > form , like a verbal verbal verbal , where it & apos ; s very seemingly accurate , description of a landscape .
because in this period of < unk > < unk > , the smell of flowers is not smell of smell , it & apos ; s the level of the learning process that doesn & apos ; t < unk > , to feel the < unk > of < unk > .
that is , the < unk > has got to translate this < unk > of energy into another , which is < unk > , more meaningful , more didn & apos ; t translate .
i & apos ; d like to talk to you today about what else i would call < unk > , or < unk > , to translate to a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation .
so i prefer to do all the way in german , because if i had to translate it back into english , it would be really something like i did in translation of translation in translation .
so , music works the same for me as spoken to spoken to spoken to spoken word .
the < unk > notes have the function of the letter of a writing .
so it & apos ; s not just learning to read music , and it & apos ; s going to pass out of the piano or the right place to hit the piano .
you know , that & apos ; s just the letters you & apos ; ve learned to paint .
you can see the sense of the letter , once you get the language to do that .
so you need to have a learning process for the music < unk > , or at least just like for the spoken word .
there & apos ; s also , there & apos ; s < unk > , whether you & apos ; re learning it or you can understand it , or you can talk to the musical speakers .
so the work of the learning process begins very similar to what a < unk > .
so after you & apos ; ve chosen to play , because you get excited about this , you & apos ; re going to go to < unk > of the composition .
you collect information about the play in the < unk > .
you read in the letters , < unk > , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts about composers themselves .
studied the works that he had before and after shot .
you compare to compare .
the < unk > to write it .
how and what did he do ?
what are its environments like the society and the politics ?
i & apos ; m interested in all of that .
and you & apos ; re thinking back in this period , like you & apos ; re watching contemporary pictures or literature .
however , over time , you & apos ; re also having a rich knowledge to be the composers that you & apos ; re playing more and more easily , and you & apos ; re getting into the < unk > and feeling that you & apos ; re holding onto .
the composer is going to live more and more to the friend that you live together .
his cause to write the play , every time , becomes more and more of my personal cause , to play it .
now , because the notes represents anything but an exact record of the composers , but only a framework , i now turn that framework on to < unk > it back to meaning and meaning .
i then say to my own words about what could be written between that framework .
i & apos ; ll play video games about what these notes might be .
now for me , and for the composers back then , and what may it mean for him today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense of that , because i feel it myself , because it & apos ; s from my own personal brain system .
it & apos ; s got to be in for me and now < unk > , otherwise i can & apos ; t convince my audience that that & apos ; s my cause .
it & apos ; s always a very happy concert when i have to have the experience that i & apos ; ve been doing that for a long time to understand how new it is .
how to < unk > a happy new day , although with the same rituals of life , < unk > , < unk > , the work , i & apos ; m always getting the same piece of the same thing over and over again .
i & apos ; d become older that change seasons , my pulse at night , slow down in the morning , in a time it takes longer that the sound comes back home than it did at home .
i & apos ; m going to take the breath of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
all these things that affect me and all that affects my experience of the composition .
it & apos ; s wonderful even though i & apos ; m standing on stage with a < unk > stage and we have the same wavelength .
you & apos ; re going to see the same thing happening in a good , engaging conversation .
you make a new idea in it , and it & apos ; ll answer it with a reaction to a reaction .
it & apos ; s exciting because then things that we don & apos ; t have < unk > , and can & apos ; t do that kind of stuff .
it & apos ; s a great fun to make music this way , and you & apos ; re an audience , and you & apos ; ve experienced music communicate alive .
so every concert is a different concert .
i & apos ; m never going to play more like that moment .
i can & apos ; t play as much as i play in 20 years .
so i & apos ; m going to have more < unk > than now , and therefore , on my palette of < unk > , have much more < unk > , emotions and senses than it is now .
sure , i & apos ; m going to have some < unk > < unk > too , but for that new kind of thing .
have a nice example of that .
it was on a < unk > team for my loved ones , professor < unk > , professor < unk > , a known < unk > , < unk > , and a professor of < unk > there in < unk > .
unfortunately , i & apos ; ve been too young so that he & apos ; s already < unk > when i finally started studying .
but i was fortunate enough to get to meet him very early , with 13 , and so i & apos ; ve been to my high school students .
i was 17 , when i was on one of his classes again , playing the last four < unk > of the chopin , a < unk > .
he asked me what the introduction of these < unk > was for me .
that & apos ; s one of those < unk > .
and in my < unk > , i said expectation .
and he was like , & quot ; he & apos ; s talking , & quot ; right ?
that & apos ; s got to be the < unk > .
because to me , it & apos ; s memory .
he & apos ; s already on < unk > .
well , there were 17 times you still have dreams , but there are no significant memories .
i & apos ; m going to play it back every couple of years , and i & apos ; m always worried , even though it hasn & apos ; t changed a grade .
every time it & apos ; s exciting because every time i read something new .
one example of this , i think , is a whole new domain -- really did have a < unk > < unk > < unk > .
it & apos ; s always the same garden , but it & apos ; s too different < unk > , at < unk > light .
he & apos ; s translated off the < unk > < unk > , as he & apos ; s seen it , as it did at that point to him .
his personal also in the < unk > .
the most creative interpretation of a piece of it is like this .
in addition , i & apos ; ve been older than chopin with < unk > when he wrote that piece .
he only lived < unk > years .
and it & apos ; s important for me to look back into the notes , even though i think i & apos ; m memorized it .
to keep music directly with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he & apos ; s died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to do it just like spoken to spoken word .
often , the most common thing is you & apos ; re learning to read the notes .
you & apos ; re learning to read before you just speak one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers are on time and right just like they & apos ; re moving , the notes come together , the notes come together like music .
when this happens , the student gets the < unk > piece on it .
there & apos ; s hardly any interpretation that you & apos ; re talking about .
well , there it is then < unk > at the beginning , that & apos ; s a quick piece .
slowly , slowly .
according to , < unk > , f and b , etc .
most of you know this .
but even though you put this data on , there & apos ; s still only slightly technical one left .
and still , it & apos ; s not interpretation .
& quot ; i wonder . & quot ;
i wonder that you & apos ; re often < unk > a little bit .
and that is , to make music on your instrument , to do your own musical work , and feel like you & apos ; ve been there before .
that & apos ; s the singing .
a child who didn & apos ; t learn singing the singing because the parents did not want to be < unk > , it won & apos ; t be done by themselves .
this is like being < unk > .
it & apos ; s necessary to have your own experiences and the idea of music , and then to get it to another way , so to get over the instrument .
people that have never been < unk > , have never felt directly with your own body , like it is to form a sound .
create a phrase with his own breath .
it & apos ; s the ability to < unk > our body .
our vocal vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the < unk > in the piano are the sequel of my finger .
the melody comes out of the < unk > and rhythm and rhythm of dance .
< unk > < unk > music today isn & apos ; t < unk > .
because you don & apos ; t need to make music anymore when it & apos ; s going to get bored .
no longer required to whistle or sing a < unk > .
each music is going to be < unk > if you & apos ; re constantly < unk > by music on the outside .
sure , there are some of you who say , yeah , but what do you do when i & apos ; m not singing ?
the question i think you can & apos ; t sing , a , because you believe you can & apos ; t sing ?
or b , because they have not learned to sing ?
in both , it & apos ; s not too late to start with trying to figure out if they can & apos ; t , or learn how to use these little muscles that are using the vocal ones , right ?
and that & apos ; s really what you can train .
c , c , you have told them they & apos ; re < unk > .
so then i ask , how powerful was this diagnosis ?
have you been getting a < unk > or a < unk > , what you say it looks like today ?
or d , you don & apos ; t like music , and therefore , you don & apos ; t want to have nothing to do with it .
but what i would say to regret is that music is a neat , < unk > thing .
but maybe you can still make them < unk > .
well , so you see , in all cases no one & apos ; s got to be a forth .
but don & apos ; t say , i don & apos ; t understand anything of classical music either .
i can & apos ; t tell if it & apos ; s good or bad .
i & apos ; m going to say that , but surely you can tell if you don & apos ; t like it or not .
because i don & apos ; t think it says somebody . i don & apos ; t know if it tastes me to cook , because i can & apos ; t cook .
so , they & apos ; re not going to eat , just because they can & apos ; t cook .
so they don & apos ; t have to do classical music , because they don & apos ; t play an instrument .
listen consciously , tell them , don & apos ; t you mind if it tastes you or not .
whether or not the music is too sweet or too cute .
tell me what you & apos ; re feeling .
now , over time , you & apos ; re also going to get hot , and you want to get a little more dogs there , or even taste differences out there .
now why am i asking you this audience to listen to it as well ?
because music is a language , and a language is there to communicate .
and an art that you & apos ; re never looking at has no force .
the food that & apos ; s seen from a chef or a chef has been killed , has to be eaten , not only by looking at or recipes .
so please , if you & apos ; re playing music , please .
it & apos ; s not just a nice < unk > .
if in an area where the adults do active music or at least listen to music , a child grow up , it & apos ; s very easy for a < unk > to ask , what color is your flower ?
can you play it also in blue now ?
and the child is playing , after a < unk > , rather than a red flower , now a blue flower .
and this sounds very different from what it is before .
that & apos ; s the first ever beginning of its own musical expression .
so the first step in a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of today that was written before a hundred , < unk > or even < unk > years ago ?
there & apos ; s some instruments out there that are < unk > .
there was no piano at the time as an instrument , no piano .
it wasn & apos ; t invented yet .
i think that the stream would have been incredibly excited if he had the best chance in the modern world today .
i can & apos ; t have the < unk > that the stream he had on the modern wing , what a < unk > < unk > can & apos ; t .
again , beethoven man knows that he heard more when he left deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is capable of playing everything that a orchestra from then used to be rejected as a < unk > .
so the composers on < unk > rely on us to < unk > the pieces .
and in order for you to < unk > what you & apos ; ve just imagined in the mind .
and again , what you & apos ; d think in the mind today .
or , you know , what i & apos ; m thinking today , because what you might be thinking .
thank you .
do you know what envy is ?
have you ever been well ?
and how did that feel ?
sucks .
i have a friend who drives a < unk > .
so when i come , with my little v up , and next to me , there & apos ; s a feeling coming up .
i & apos ; m taking away with my head .
i say , < unk > , why do you need to have that big car ?
that & apos ; s a great deal , in the first year , half of its value .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why would i have to afford & quot ; n little car ? & quot ;
and then i can think of it immediately , that & apos ; s unfair .
this is against justice .
and , as i say to the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
so , our organism has invented a great way of making these ridiculous feelings like envy just to disappear .
you can try it with words like revenge or < unk > or things like that .
i want to talk to you about this mechanism today , something that < unk > you may be familiar with .
the mechanism is from lie .
but don & apos ; t think of the lie that you & apos ; ve probably heard of if people say , no one has the intention to build a wall .
and then rocks < unk > , so he & apos ; d < unk > you & apos ; d < unk > .
on one of these lie , you & apos ; ll see that liars don & apos ; t believe what he says .
it & apos ; s very easy to check out how much he has in mind .
he just turns them around , he doesn & apos ; t < unk > himself .
no , the lie that i & apos ; m talking about , which has to do with that , that they deceive themselves .
you need that lie to form a force in order to get a out of place .
they have less easy , yeah , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > .
they need time .
some of those time , there & apos ; s an anecdote that you may be familiar with .
spanish painter < unk > picasso once has a woman < unk > .
now this woman then complained , her portrait wouldn & apos ; t even see it that way .
picasso questions , wait only .
it & apos ; s becoming like them all the time .
at this point , if you laugh , you can see how important that lie is and how much time you need to know what artists can share very well .
because artists have a < unk > proportion to the lie .
the artist shares something to you , and most importantly to this lady , what she doesn & apos ; t see if she just looks in the mirror .
the artist shares you in a portrait of something like this that you & apos ; ll be familiar with when you look at this piece of art over and over again .
and then that awkward feeling , it wouldn & apos ; t look like you and you & apos ; re always going to get similar .
here & apos ; s the mechanism , which we can use as a lie as a great invention to < unk > our < unk > .
and it & apos ; s not just in art , it & apos ; s also in < unk > , it & apos ; s in the mythology , it & apos ; s in stories that come back .
you may be familiar with this idea of the lady looking into the mirror every morning and asked him , who & apos ; s the most beautiful in the whole country ?
one day , this mirror says , yeah , there & apos ; s a mirror box .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and they also know how much hostility of this true language , even the mirror can & apos ; t lie , from this true taste .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can & apos ; t tell a woman , there & apos ; s something else to do .
here it is necessary to understand what we mean by < unk > need to put back together .
what we need at this point is this lie that < unk > the deception without which we can & apos ; t even survive .
we don & apos ; t just have a great deal in art in science , but in science that & apos ; s such great lie .
and there is this story about the woman of the village of < unk > .
they heard about this book by charles darwin , the emergence of species and ancestry of man .
that the man of the monkeys would drive over and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between humans and monkeys .
and then she ran into her husband and she said , well , that & apos ; s not true , what charles got .
the human being shall have an < unk > or a common ancestor .
no , no , you can & apos ; t .
and if it & apos ; s true , then we & apos ; ll have to prevent people from happening .
why do we have to prevent people from people who can & apos ; t get some stuff if it & apos ; s true ?
because we can & apos ; t live without those < unk > .
because we & apos ; re < unk > these did , to be great , < unk > of the highest beings , not from such a < unk > , something that & apos ; s kind of like an organism that exists , an organism and the things that are comparable to us .
so , we can & apos ; t bear with those things .
we have to prevent people from getting their attention to things , especially if they & apos ; re true .
so you can see how slowly that mechanism is off , and what the traces that he & apos ; s leaving with something other than this great image of ourselves , i want to share another story .
so it & apos ; s a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife told me this .
she came from school one day , she & apos ; s a teacher , and she talked about a student .
a < unk > student .
it likes a great deal , because it & apos ; s got a tendency to make ideas come and join them .
and she asked him , what are your french ?
and that & apos ; s what he says , well , i & apos ; m on fire fire .
and that & apos ; s because i & apos ; m with the fire department , i & apos ; m interested in doing things .
yeah , you feel it when you & apos ; re in this place . something & apos ; s wrong .
i & apos ; ve always told my wife , whenever a man is using the moral framework because we & apos ; re going to try to replace it even by < unk > .
once you do that , and then you experience the phrase .
even though i & apos ; m at the fire department , i & apos ; m interested in living things .
you feel that that & apos ; s the actual truth behind the pull .
it & apos ; s a little bit of a money < unk > that doesn & apos ; t matter very much .
interested in coming up with the < unk > .
but there are no clubs that we can look around , where you learn how to fire .
there & apos ; s just the second best part , just the fire department .
so , he signed up .
and < unk > , he doesn & apos ; t say to his teacher , you don & apos ; t like to put fire somewhere , and you & apos ; re comfortable with fire later on .
no , it looks just a lot better if we show that we are in charge to remove the dangers that other people do when they & apos ; re on fire .
so there & apos ; s this little mechanism .
this < unk > on the < unk > of < unk > knew it & apos ; s actually related to fire , but that it can & apos ; t say it loud .
here you have this < unk > between the unconscious and the fun , which immediately makes you feel like you can do something about it , and the things that you know look very different , make you look like it much better for others and better .
so then you have words like this that we use in the language of the politically correct language .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know when we < unk > those out , the social thank you very sensitive .
we can & apos ; t make that easy .
there & apos ; s no way of presenting this in a society that & apos ; s supposed to work .
so i & apos ; d like to give you a hold of what we found at my institute .
according to what extent this deception , these self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the ones that we actually know in the unconscious knowledge that it & apos ; s valid to spread outside .
i want to share with you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few of you don & apos ; t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
so the soul is that something that says about leibniz .
it is something that is < unk > < unk > , physical nature .
and if you have people who have a strong belief that they have a soul , or you can say , the belief that they & apos ; re brought to life , it & apos ; s a < unk > , like that & apos ; s all about , you know , < unk > your american partner .
and from that soul , you now think that you & apos ; re in this < unk > nature , in this < unk > nature , < unk > , it & apos ; s in latin , the < unk > , present .
and if this mass of thinking about the people , then it & apos ; s < unk > with them , with nature , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
it can be < unk > .
that & apos ; s the idea of the soul .
so it & apos ; s supposed to get from the outside to people .
so we should perceive them as something that is vital to our life .
and if you have this assumption , then you understand the logic that we & apos ; re going to experience happiness in a way that we can improve our world .
because now , you can put on a < unk > .
< unk > , you & apos ; re still familiar with school .
this is now a logic report that describes a logic .
this , by the way , is the hardest part of my talk .
you need some logic here , but you need to lie .
that & apos ; s because lying like they can & apos ; t use these logic as simple as that .
so there & apos ; s three sentences in this water body .
the first sentence is , < unk > says , there is no soul .
so the second sentence is that when < unk > gets right , he doesn & apos ; t have soul .
now there & apos ; s a third sentence .
i particularly interviewed him here .
a third set that immediately comes to people who have a strong sense of soul .
the people say , who & apos ; s got no soul , he & apos ; s dead , and they can & apos ; t claim anything .
and you feel that way .
so here & apos ; s this logic , yeah , in that < unk > talk .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they & apos ; re logical correct .
because i can say everything .
logic doesn & apos ; t tell you about reality .
i can say the < unk > is a man .
and if i & apos ; m right , then the < unk > is a man .
if i & apos ; m not right , then the < unk > is not a man .
logic doesn & apos ; t really matter what & apos ; s going on .
i can say everything .
but critically , if i & apos ; m right , it & apos ; s true .
so if < unk > says there & apos ; s no soul .
second , if he & apos ; s right , he & apos ; s got no soul .
those things make sense right .
and now our real consciousness can immediately be felt like we can do something .
it depends on the third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that & apos ; s what the opposite of the first sentence has already proven and < unk > .
because we actually have to prove that there is a soul or not .
but with this logic that it & apos ; s just using that two sentences are logical and a third < unk > that looks like it had to do something about it , so we can save the life of the day .
so , we pretend that it & apos ; s actually impossible not to live without a soul .
and we are very happy about this .
we can continue these things to different examples .
in the present day , for example , we have a very modern example , which keeps filling up .
now you have to take on another < unk > theme , which is a philosophy of philosophy , and come with me .
and it has to do with bringing us back to the 21st century .
now , there was a scholars , which was called < unk > , and after that it & apos ; s called the < unk > < unk > < unk > .
the < unk > < unk > is a < unk > made of pure nature .
it doesn & apos ; t have that soul .
that & apos ; s such a thing .
and if you put that perfectly in the middle between two < unk > try and place , then you & apos ; re going to < unk > him .
because he doesn & apos ; t know which cover to go first .
so he & apos ; s right in the middle .
so you & apos ; ve presented the < unk > .
forces solve forces of one another & apos ; s < unk > forces .
there & apos ; s nothing happening .
just if you give another example , well , if you make the same spot immediately , then you don & apos ; t need reason , and you don & apos ; t need reason .
he & apos ; s automatically running to the right thoughts .
so if you have this idea that somehow you & apos ; re pushed into nature , you & apos ; re < unk > by the larger pile that you have right away , so quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and if we & apos ; re in < unk > right now , i remember the < unk > process .
there & apos ; s a scholars , which is called wolf , and you end up telling them , you know , wolf doesn & apos ; t say , wolf , you know , there & apos ; s no < unk > .
now we can take the second sentence again and say , if wolf is right , then he & apos ; s not going to be a < unk > .
these sentences are perfectly logical and accurate .
and what we can almost be able to read in the daily newspaper that & apos ; s in that third sentence .
it looks something like this , who doesn & apos ; t have any < unk > , can & apos ; t be taken for its action and claims to the responsibility and therefore it & apos ; s < unk > .
again , they & apos ; ve got it .
in fact , you would have to prove that there is such thing as < unk > .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that , as if the first sentence of ever came wrong , as a result of the opposite , is to take on the opposite of no evidence .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything yourself and , especially if you want to make people happy , have this courage for lie .
for example , if you meet a human being that you can say , there are no < unk > .
and please , don & apos ; t use the german word for < unk > , which is called prophet .
they & apos ; re not allowed to say that this would be a little political back then .
let & apos ; s say there & apos ; s no < unk > .
immediately you & apos ; re going to be able to know that for which , of course , there are < unk > , that you can & apos ; t prove it .
and they already have a problem .
because while they & apos ; re busy , they & apos ; re told they can & apos ; t prove that there & apos ; s no < unk > , the man is very happy .
he & apos ; s very happy about this because he & apos ; s fooled them .
because he led them to an < unk > machine that he himself didn & apos ; t even hold himself down .
because , actually , this man was not interested in evidence .
he & apos ; s only interested in < unk > himself in the need to prove that there are environmental issues .
so , in the way this shift happening , they & apos ; re experiencing the opening of the lie .
and once again , if you have a chance to feel this < unk > with other people , do it because you & apos ; ll be happy if you don & apos ; t remember them that way .
i thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
so i allowed myself to ask < unk > , can i mention them ?
she & apos ; s one of the most wonderful things that we see here , and he asked me if i really wanted to give a talk and take my idea away .
i & apos ; ve got to say , you know , it & apos ; s got to be very difficult to tell me to talk about my idea .
and i may also get the idea that i & apos ; m going to try to imagine .
but it & apos ; s , of course , the sum , lots of ideas .
i & apos ; m probably more likely to be the two nice girls , i & apos ; m likely to be the generation that & apos ; s happened for this bad < unk > image , because i & apos ; ve already started studying < unk > original girl at < unk > , that & apos ; s when i think it & apos ; s starting to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to know .
and i started out in the < unk > < unk > for berlin because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that wasn & apos ; t what we got in the middle of < unk > .
there was the < unk > < unk > there .
and they were all < unk > , and the was the < unk > as well as < unk > .
they are now called < unk > .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or < unk > .
but that < unk > like & apos ; n < unk > , from somehow a hundred watts in the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin there was a crazy < unk > .
and i & apos ; m grateful to the fact that he & apos ; s < unk > the word again , because after the time you didn & apos ; t use the word anymore , it & apos ; s not because everything on the left was bad .
but that wasn & apos ; t the only way that happened in the years .
it just so happened that there was < unk > < unk > , and one of them just sat down in the < unk > < unk > where you thought it was evil .
and the place of the < unk > was < unk > and < unk > and solar power , and that & apos ; s when i started in the < unk > .
and yeah , a lot of what i & apos ; ve been told this today is something that i & apos ; ve been very concerned with , because a lot of beautiful expressions that i & apos ; ve lived through .
i & apos ; ve been working in the collectively , this was < unk > .
we were 20 people .
if one wasn & apos ; t said that , it was the < unk > , which actually has a perfectly < unk > , and i & apos ; ve been in for 10 years , i & apos ; ve had a lot of my great < unk > < unk > < unk > maybe , because you & apos ; re having a < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > .
it & apos ; s engaging with skills .
and it & apos ; s been really very , very < unk > , and then you get into it this way , and it & apos ; s a picture that & apos ; s kind of < unk > where i & apos ; ve asked myself , after 10 years , the < unk > , the < unk > of course , of course , the < unk > .
and i put it till < unk > , and then i & apos ; ve become < unk > with friends of the company to < unk > , who then got along with the < unk > < unk > < unk > of one of the world & apos ; s biggest < unk > .
a < unk > , but also we again have the problem of a growing company , and we then have < unk > , a small group decided that we & apos ; re going to take back and go back to the next topic of the future , and we don & apos ; t think that & apos ; s crazy , and it & apos ; s crazy .
and i brought a project i want to share with you now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how do you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we have just started with a relatively < unk > story , where would you have had a sense of memory today .
this island , this is < unk > island on the island of < unk > .
yeah , it & apos ; s the data .
there & apos ; s four and a thousand people living there .
they have renewables today & apos ; s approach to fifteen percent .
and the question is , why don & apos ; t they do it anymore ?
they & apos ; re just not going to do technological here .
if you fail more < unk > , then the system starts to fail .
that & apos ; s always the politicians when they & apos ; re in < unk > , when they & apos ; re < unk > our facility .
they & apos ; re always saying , why ?
we & apos ; ve got 20 percent in germany .
it can & apos ; t be a problem .
but is not true , we & apos ; ve seen seven percent in europe , and our internet is physically the european one .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have had the same problems that people have on the island .
the question was simple , if you want to go back to this , the first contacts with the island , it & apos ; s just been done over time .
it would have to be that big a battery so that you would have to have an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , maybe even < unk > percent renewable .
and yeah . i & apos ; m going to go a little further .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred < unk > < unk > of < unk > get < unk > around the world .
that & apos ; s the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it & apos ; s particularly quick .
the world & apos ; s < unk > , it & apos ; s taken place , it & apos ; s being erased because you don & apos ; t need any permission .
it & apos ; s fast .
and you put yourself in the right box .
and then it usually looks like this .
there & apos ; s always three of the < unk > going on , and two of them always are waiting .
yeah , that & apos ; s what & apos ; s right there , that & apos ; s a load .
we also got very detailed data .
and < unk > , or < unk > , or whatever it is , is that it & apos ; s usually an < unk > system , or it & apos ; s a system , which can only < unk > in small quantities here .
the goal was to say , & quot ; ok . & quot ;
it & apos ; s going to operate all the way around , and the wind , the sun is < unk > the load so you can map the larger proportion .
and if you want to go on 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn off the system .
that means , at the moment , you have to worry that renewables can take on the whole grid , if you will .
you can only , of course , if you & apos ; re any kind of < unk > there .
no one & apos ; s done that in the world .
there & apos ; s this in a small style , so you can use your car in your car on a small scale .
people always ask me , what & apos ; s in your life like this , but you know , < unk > ?
i mean , that & apos ; s the end result .
but if you want to build multiple < unk > of these < unk > , and they have to build a net , it & apos ; s extremely complicated .
and our goal was to come to a < unk > percent of renewable , and then there & apos ; s this rest here , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable renewable energy , which is very , very expensive and it & apos ; s not going to work , it & apos ; s made out .
this will be , in any case , an energy that will be hydrogen , methane , soft gas , you know or < unk > that will be it .
they & apos ; ll have to go a < unk > and < unk > and not just < unk > .
we just wanted to know what it is with a regular , < unk > battery < unk > .
now , how far will you get there ?
and then i did a whole bunch of simulation .
and have wind and sun , and the load came along , and came to the result , a very interesting result : that , across the conventional system , that after 20 years , you need an < unk > of about 50 cents per < unk > , about < unk > .
that was the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
yeah , great , then we have a business model .
we & apos ; re cheaper than < unk > if you get five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating like the < unk > .
what would it have to be done ?
do we negotiate with investors , i & apos ; ve been looking for new business models .
we were only five people back then to < unk > society .
and then again , that & apos ; s where we & apos ; re going .
the brown brown is sort of the conventional system , the green one is our system .
also , our system has a < unk > system is because we & apos ; re going to do 20 percent of them with each other , and we don & apos ; t have any < unk > on the other .
and the < unk > that < unk > the island on the island , it & apos ; s what we & apos ; re looking at .
let & apos ; s also support , but we don & apos ; t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we & apos ; re sort of able to map the electric island of the island at the scale of the island to get it right now .
that is , we then went out and found the world & apos ; s biggest battery .
here she is .
this is < unk > from asia , in the case of japan .
and < unk > , it & apos ; s been developed in the & apos ; 70s during the & apos ; 70s , now , < unk > , and then < unk > to the japanese .
you can see , it & apos ; s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of power , and it can take that power for six hours , and that & apos ; s the battery that we & apos ; ve sort of < unk > .
and then they set it up .
we also have an entire < unk > system in the same size that he & apos ; s standing in the back room to actually get the full dynamic behavior of this thing , so in the hall it looks like this , because it & apos ; s standing here , the < unk > , the battery here are the big battery , the whole .
what we & apos ; re actually doing over here is we & apos ; re < unk > the whole < unk > wire , the cable industry , to kind of represent the net in the net .
and then again , you can see that whole thing again .
we can also < unk > < unk > < unk > on the net .
and again , we see this again , we see the < unk > again , again , the whole , individual < unk > .
and what we & apos ; ve done since < unk > was the hall then done , until today , basically everything between the individual system to electronics is something we & apos ; ve done .
so we & apos ; re not < unk > , we define ourselves as a company , which is only between the subject and the net and everything in between .
you have to , of course , communicate to the battery , you have to also be able to communicate to the net , and that & apos ; s very complicated .
the beauty is that , on this island , you can basically take on the < unk > problem today that we & apos ; re going to get if we & apos ; re going to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion is going to be going back and forth , < unk > , how this should go , on the island , for example , for < unk > to < unk > percent , so we & apos ; re < unk > the wind and the sun .
< unk > then offers the < unk > .
so < unk > , a < unk > everywhere .
we can integrate this on the island , we can integrate < unk > , < unk > , if you can manage the load .
that means if you & apos ; re at six percent renewable , then you can & apos ; t do that without memory .
you can go through n well , you can go through < unk > networks , yeah , so you should do that on any case , the percentage of your body , but you & apos ; re never going to get < unk > to memory .
that & apos ; s such n & apos ; n the message .
that & apos ; s why a lot of people come , and look at this , because you can see what kind of problems you can get .
when we turn the < unk > , you have no more those spinning mass , which causes some lack of energy on the net .
and our < unk > < unk > consists of essentially getting massive masses of big masses of big products , where the wave is all about , all over europe , all about way across europe .
we & apos ; re looking in this net , and we & apos ; re looking at 50 . and if it & apos ; s going to < unk > < unk > , we & apos ; re going to put a couple of little < unk > < unk > , we & apos ; re going to be < unk > .
that & apos ; s the system .
and of course , it & apos ; s incredibly sophisticated .
if that & apos ; s somewhere , it & apos ; s a great deal of time .
it & apos ; s got at least 10 seconds of keeping the net stable .
and in time , you can respond to other people .
if you don & apos ; t have that anymore , you have that mass , then you have to replace it with < unk > and < unk > .
and we can use that big battery once again two milliseconds .
so , you & apos ; ve got , you & apos ; ve got the enormous amount of information that you & apos ; ve got there .
and the message is , we & apos ; ve got to get rid of the masses of those masses , if we & apos ; re to sort of our goals , 20 percent , 30 percent , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 percent , 30 and so on if we want to achieve it .
and then we have to break our < unk > capacity across the net .
< unk > is just saying the power station is going on in order to keep the frequency .
yeah , that & apos ; s a < unk > right now , < unk > from the < unk > , because we do not , or < unk > , because you can & apos ; t .
and what we & apos ; re just trying to do is we & apos ; re going to < unk > the capacity , the < unk > capacity , the < unk > , the < unk > way of creating memory on the net .
and there & apos ; s also a whole lot of studies now .
and at that point , people always come and look at our < unk > on , sort of , our < unk > .
and yes , the debate is always about the question , how far can you get a piece of future there .
and a lot of discussions that i & apos ; ve had in the last six years was very similar to the discussion i & apos ; ve had over the last 30 years .
you can & apos ; t , you know , central planning , we & apos ; re going to throw it all together . never go .
we have < unk > < unk > today in germany .
this is < unk > .
and i & apos ; m just going to say we & apos ; re going to have the same capacity in the next 30 years to store all over the world .
very simple , so it & apos ; s going to come .
there will be a whole lot of < unk > and arguments .
the beauty is that i & apos ; ve experienced , in the last two years , that the scientists have gone to my side .
we & apos ; ve also had over tens of millions of < unk > < unk > now to be < unk > on the german net .
this will happen in april next april .
so , from that , you also realize that there is a change in this change , and it & apos ; s only from this point of view , to the point of renewable technology , to a hundred percent renewable change .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , that & apos ; s like a < unk > system .
so far , arguments have always been trying to < unk > , have a very small net , which has nothing to do with our belief system .
now , the question is really simple , if they get completely different from some fossil or < unk > , which are going to be < unk > anywhere in the world and < unk > to them , they & apos ; re an island .
and then they only consume what & apos ; s on sun and wind , where they live .
and that is a little bit of our vision of a < unk > energy and i & apos ; m also grateful that they said solar energy .
and that & apos ; s what we & apos ; re doing , and in this way , the talk of < unk > < unk > that you & apos ; re allowed to be a collective and solar power , here a little bit together .
and yeah well , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay there quite < unk > , but i think it & apos ; s going on .
thank you .
when steve there was ahead of los angeles times , one day , through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an permanent , < unk > , homeless , homeless , who was playing on a violin , who had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from < unk > articles on it later , a book that became < unk > , with robert junior as steve very , and jamie < unk > , who was a good scientist , who was a < unk > career in the early days of < unk > .
nathaniel < unk > , < unk > a < unk > and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless person on the streets of < unk > row at the center of los angeles .
i strongly recommend reading all the < unk > & apos ; s book or looking at the film so that they don & apos ; t just understand the wonderful connectedness that & apos ; s come from these two men , but also how the music helped to make that connection is , if it & apos ; s a good tool of good design is actually it .
i met mr. < unk > in 2008 , two years ago , in was < unk > disney hall .
he had just heard a show of beethoven & apos ; s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he talked in a very kind of < unk > and < unk > note about right & apos ; s < unk > clinton and over how the dodgers clinton would never make it into the baseball world & apos ; s < unk > . and that & apos ; s all because of the < unk > part of the first violin in the last flight .
so we got to the theme of music . and a few days later , i got an email , which said that nathaniel < unk > was interested in me .
i must say that nathaniel took a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electricity and < unk > , a trauma that has followed him his whole life .
so , as a result of that , it & apos ; s particularly vulnerable to these stages of started . they & apos ; re sometimes so bad , and it disappears in the streets of < unk > row , always < unk > row , to this sort of horror and the < unk > of his mind .
and in fact , in the same way that you can see , nathaniel , when we started with our first class class , when we started in downtown disney hall , and he had lost this < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > into his eyes and completely lost .
he talked about invisible < unk > and smoke and how someone wanted to poison him in their sleep .
i was afraid not to < unk > , but i was afraid i could lose him that he could fit into one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin , if i started to talk about the color and the exciting < unk > and other < unk > of the world .
so i just started playing .
i was playing the first set of beethoven & apos ; s favorite music .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in < unk > eyes there was a whole lot of change going on .
it was as though it was under the influence of a invisible < unk > , a chemical reaction where my catalyst was my game .
< unk > < unk > anger turned to understanding , into a quiet curiosity and grace .
and as through a miracle , he took his violin , and he started playing some clips of < unk > , and then asking me to play them out : < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > .
and we then started talking about music , starting from music on beethoven , < unk > , < unk > and all the others < unk > , from < unk > to < unk > < unk > .
and i realized that , in fact , it had an < unk > knowledge about music , but it also had a strong personal relationship with it .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i else knew from my colleagues in los angeles .
by talking about music and music , from this sort of < unk > , < unk > man who had just moved on through the streets of los angeles , a < unk > , < unk > , closed tools in < unk > musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
to nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to < unk > his mind and your imagination with your imagination and creativity into something really profound .
so he designed his < unk > state < unk > .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
that & apos ; s why we make music , so that we have something inside , which is deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , to really form our creativity .
and the reality of that expression is coming at us all , and it & apos ; s inspired , and it & apos ; s united to us .
what nathaniel < unk > was going to bring back the music to a community of friends .
the < unk > force of music brought it back into a family of musicians who understood it , who understood his talent and took him away .
and i & apos ; m going to repeat again and again with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney hall or in < unk > row , because he reminds me of why i & apos ; m a musician .
thank you .
bruno < unk > : thank you . thank you .
robert start .
robert coming : i want to play something that i stole the < unk > .
i hope you & apos ; ll forgive me .
so i & apos ; ve seen a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
the first one , that was more like a passionate < unk > .
it was a nice fish , < unk > , good texture , < unk > , a < unk > on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was raised in < unk > after the highest standards in sustainability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
one day , the head of the company called , and he asked if i could make a case about the sustainability of the farm .
& quot ; of course , & quot ; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem would have made for our it . how do we keep fish on our fish ?
in the last 50 years , we & apos ; ve hit the oceans like we & apos ; ve had bare forests .
it & apos ; s hard to < unk > destruction .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tunas we love , the tuna , the < unk > , the < unk > , the < unk > , they & apos ; re collapsed .
there & apos ; s almost nothing left .
so it & apos ; s going to be kind of a < unk > or something that & apos ; s going to be a part of our future .
many arguments against this . < unk > are the environment that most of you anyway , and they & apos ; re inefficient , let & apos ; s take tuna . big < unk > .
it & apos ; s got < unk > going from 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of communication is required to get a pound of < unk > .
not very sustainable .
it doesn & apos ; t taste very well .
so here was finally a company that tried to get it right .
i wanted to supported them .
so the day before the event , i called the head of the public relations for the company .
don & apos ; t call him don .
& quot ; don & quot ; i said , & quot ; just to get the facts right , you & apos ; re famous for < unk > out in the ocean that you don & apos ; t < unk > the environment . & quot ;
& quot ; that & apos ; s true , & quot ; he said . & quot ; we & apos ; re so far out there that waste is distributed by our fish , not concentrated . & quot ;
and then he added , & quot ; we & apos ; re basically a world .
this < unk > of < unk > to one & apos ; s & quot ; he said .
& quot ; the best in industry . & quot ;
< unk > to one , great .
& quot ; < unk > to one thing ? what feeds you ? & quot ;
& quot ; sustainable proteins , & quot ; he said .
& quot ; great , & quot ; i said .
and that evening , i was in bed , thinking , what the hell & apos ; s a sustainable protein ?
so i came the next day , just before the event , don & apos ; t , don & apos ; t .
i said , & quot ; don , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? & quot ;
he said he didn & apos ; t know . he & apos ; s going to stand up .
now , i put some people in the company , and no one could give me a flat answer , until finally , with the senior biologists .
don & apos ; t call him don .
don & apos ; t i said , & quot ; what for example are sustainable proteins ? & quot ;
now , he mentioned some algae and some < unk > , and then he said , < unk > .
i said , & quot ; < unk > ? & quot ;
he said , & quot ; yeah , yeah , skin , skin , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > and < unk > . & quot ;
i said , & quot ; what percentage of your chicken is chicken ? & quot ;
assumption , maybe two percent .
& quot ; well , that & apos ; s about 30 percent , & quot ; he said .
i said , & quot ; don & apos ; t , what & apos ; s sustainable to feed chicken ? & quot ;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , & quot ; there & apos ; s just too much chicken on the planet . & quot ;
i & apos ; m < unk > by this fish .
no , it & apos ; s not because i & apos ; m a < unk > , it & apos ; s a < unk > .
this is actually me .
no , i actually < unk > from this fish because i swear to god after this conversation after chicken .
this second fish , this is another kind of love .
it & apos ; s the romantic species , the kind you know , the better you know your fish , you love the more fish you love .
i first ate him in a restaurant in < unk > .
a < unk > journalist had talked about this fish for a long time .
it & apos ; s effectively < unk > us .
he came to the table with a bright , almost < unk > white color .
the chef had < unk > it .
hold it twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can taste such a fish so well after he got < unk > ?
i can & apos ; t , but this guy can .
let & apos ; s call him < unk > . actually , he & apos ; s called < unk > .
and no , he didn & apos ; t hold off the fish , and he & apos ; s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand one .
it & apos ; s a biologist at < unk > la < unk > .
this is a < unk > in the < unk > corner .
she & apos ; s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , this farm was in the hands of < unk > .
they were growing < unk > on what were actually wetlands .
what they did was they took the land .
and they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they found it < unk > water out of the country and out into the river .
now , they couldn & apos ; t make the difference that they didn & apos ; t make good economic case .
and green was a catastrophe .
it & apos ; s about 90 percent of the birds around , which many birds have been for this place .
and so in 1982 a spanish company has bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the river of the water around them .
they literally broke the lever .
instead of using the water < unk > , they used the channels to < unk > the water .
they & apos ; re < unk > the channels .
they created a simpler world -- < unk > , < unk > , shrimp , shrimp , < unk > -- and with that , < unk > and his company completely < unk > the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they & apos ; ve never seen anything like this .
they just stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all they & apos ; re < unk > channels and these density , heavy march .
i wasn & apos ; t alone a very long time ago .
it & apos ; s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and some part of & quot ; a crocodile to kiss . & quot ;
ok ? we were , and we fought by the wetlands , and i < unk > , and i < unk > , and < unk > to my knees , and i < unk > to < unk > a < unk > .
here he picks up a rare < unk > .
now he mentioned the < unk > of < unk > .
and here , it & apos ; s looking at a pattern of would be remembered by the < unk > giraffe .
it turns out that < unk > has spent most of his career in < unk > national park in africa .
i asked him how he & apos ; d become that < unk > .
he said , & quot ; fish ? i don & apos ; t know anything about fish .
i & apos ; m an expert in relationships . & quot ;
and then he < unk > and < unk > into more < unk > of rare birds and algae and strange < unk > .
and don & apos ; t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , < unk > community , like that .
it & apos ; s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this < unk > piece of < unk > fish that i had at mit < unk > .
so i cut him off . i said , & quot ; < unk > , how come your fish as well tastes ? & quot ;
he showed up on the algae .
& quot ; i know , boy , the algae , the < unk > , the < unk > , it & apos ; s unbelievable .
but what do you eat ?
what & apos ; s the design brief ? & quot ;
now he & apos ; s continues to tell me that it & apos ; s a base system , that fish are eating what they & apos ; d eat in the wild .
& quot ; fire biomass , & quot ; the we make , & quot ; is the fish , & quot ; which feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it & apos ; s totally < unk > .
there & apos ; s no food .
the more talked about a farm that isn & apos ; t feeding their animals ?
and later on the day i went around this site with < unk > , and i asked him , i said , & quot ; for a place that seems so natural to be , & quot ; unlike any farm i & apos ; ve ever been at , & quot ; like success ? & quot ;
the moment it was as if an director had a director of an < unk > .
and we looked around the corner and we were looking at the most stunning sight , thousands and thousands of < unk > < unk > , a literally < unk > carpet , way back to the eye .
& quot ; that is success , & quot ; he said .
& quot ; look at your pink language .
she & apos ; s < unk > . & quot ;
< unk > ? i was completely confused .
i said , & quot ; < unk > , don & apos ; t you mind your fish ? & quot ;
& quot ; yes , & quot ; he said .
& quot ; we lose 20 percent of our fish and < unk > to the birds .
now , last year on this site , over 250 birds , were more than 250 different species .
it has become the biggest private sector today in europe .
i said , & quot ; < unk > , isn & apos ; t there any good reason you want to have on a ted conference ? & quot ;
he shook his head , no .
he said , & quot ; we & apos ; re building < unk > , not intense .
this is a network that is open network .
eat the shrimp . the shrimp eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the < unk > .
so the higher your stomach is the better the system . & quot ;
ok , let & apos ; s think about this : a farm that doesn & apos ; t feeds its animals and a farm that measures its success to the health of your predators .
a ted < unk > , but also a < unk > .
oh , and by the way , i don & apos ; t need you to be there first .
you & apos ; re breeding in a town 240 miles away , where it & apos ; s better for the city of < unk > .
they fly 240 miles every morning to the farm .
and they fly 240 miles every evening .
they & apos ; re doing it because they & apos ; re the < unk > white line of the < unk > < unk > .
seriously .
i & apos ; d taken a journey of penguins , so i looked at these things called < unk > .
i said , & quot ; < unk > , are you going to fly 240 miles , and are you going to < unk > miles an evening ?
are you doing this for the kids ? & quot ;
he looked at me when i & apos ; d just met a song at whitney .
he said , & quot ; no . they do this because the food is better . & quot ;
i didn & apos ; t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don & apos ; t like < unk > . i don & apos ; t like them . i don & apos ; t like them .
it & apos ; s this < unk > , < unk > taste .
i & apos ; m not < unk > nearly that .
and yet , when i tried this restaurant in < unk > , it really wasn & apos ; t true at all .
it liked sweet and it would be like taking a bite in the ocean .
i mentioned < unk > and he was < unk > .
he said , & quot ; the skin seems like a sponge .
it & apos ; s the last leaving before something happens in the body .
it & apos ; s evolved over evolution to < unk > < unk > . & quot ;
and then he added , & quot ; but our water doesn & apos ; t have any < unk > . & quot ;
ok . a farm that isn & apos ; t feeding their fish -- a farm that & apos ; s measuring their success at the success of their predators .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn & apos ; t have a < unk > , he & apos ; d big , because the water that flows through this farm comes out of the river .
it & apos ; s a river that & apos ; s going through all the things that have rivers in these days tend to lead them with these chemical pollutants , the < unk > of < unk > .
and if it were fought through the system , and this leaves , the water is clean as it & apos ; s environmentally friendly .
the system is so healthy , it < unk > the water .
so not only a farm that feeds its animals not only , not only a farm , which measures their own health of it , but a farm that & apos ; s literally a < unk > , and not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because when the water < unk > , it & apos ; s in the atlantic ocean .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should too , because this story , like romantic romantic always , is also < unk > .
you could say she & apos ; s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about food waste or < unk > .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , of a food that & apos ; s actually < unk > .
but for a lot of people , that & apos ; s a little bit radical .
we are not < unk > , we & apos ; re < unk > . we & apos ; re lover .
we love < unk > . we love small < unk > . we talk about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you suggest that these are the things that the future of good food is coming down somewhere and says , & quot ; hey guys , i love < unk > < unk > , but how are you going to feed the world ? & quot ;
how are you going to feed the world ? & quot ;
let me be honest ?
i don & apos ; t like that question .
no , not because we & apos ; re producing enough nutrients to feed the world more than just one .
a billion people are born today .
one billion -- that & apos ; s more than ever before -- because of < unk > positive in the distribution , not < unk > .
now , i don & apos ; t like that question , because it has determined the logic of our energy systems for the last 50 years .
< unk > grain made , < unk > to < unk > , chemicals on the earth , chicken , and the whole time just asked them , & quot ; if we feed more people cheaper , how bad is this ? & quot ;
that was the cause . it was the spread . it was the business of agriculture in america .
we should call them what she is , a industry in < unk > , a industry that < unk > fast , that enables that production to make exactly that production .
that & apos ; s not a technologies , and it & apos ; s not agriculture .
our industrial society today is threatened not by < unk > < unk > , but due to < unk > resources .
not by < unk > and < unk > and < unk > , but by lots of land , not by pumps , but by < unk > water , not by forests , and not by fish and fishing , but by fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
so let & apos ; s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that will enable each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don & apos ; t look at the future for the future .
it & apos ; s really old , and it & apos ; s done .
so capital , chemistry and machines are where it & apos ; s going , and it & apos ; s never really done a good thing to eat .
instead , look at the environmental model .
this is the one that comes out of < unk > < unk > for two billion years .
look at farmers & apos ; farmers , farmers like < unk > .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , those who grow < unk > , instead of just < unk > farmers , who are not just < unk > , but who are experts for relationships .
because they & apos ; re the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i & apos ; m really honest , you & apos ; re a better chef than i ever will .
you know , that & apos ; s right for me , because if that & apos ; s the future of good food , it & apos ; s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to tell you a little bit about it today , it & apos ; s that the total of the data we consume is greater than the sum of their parts and parts of the parts of the parts , i want you to think about how we & apos ; re using information , and we can & apos ; t be visible .
so , what we & apos ; re looking at here is a typical < unk > of old age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it & apos ; s called < unk > , and what i can do with < unk > is i can filter in a certain cause of death , let & apos ; s say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that & apos ; s moving .
and it & apos ; s because , in fact , in the space station here , people are active , and they & apos ; re right over here .
we can go a step further and line the data up and see that < unk > and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for anybody .
so as we move forward , and as we sort of age 40 , we & apos ; ll see 40 years younger , we & apos ; ll see accidents even the leading idea is to make people worry about .
and who knows that & apos ; s very true in men .
so you can see that the knowledge of information and data in this way is very remembered in a living room of information .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
what we have here are the < unk > of every single < unk > device that has ever been printed .
it & apos ; s all here . it & apos ; s all online .
you can test it by my talk in your < unk > .
you can dive into a decade and an decade of that .
it can be taken in a particular year .
they can jump directly to a particular issue .
now , when i look here , i & apos ; m seeing the athletes that are coming into that issue and that & apos ; s what you see .
i & apos ; m a < unk > fan , so i click this way , so i & apos ; m going to show all these moments in which < unk > armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i just want to get an < unk > overview , i might think , & quot ; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject of what i & apos ; m talking about ? & quot ;
so i take that step back and i took that view .
now i see greg < unk > .
and so you get an idea that if you & apos ; re on that kind of information , < unk > , big , < unk > , < unk > , you don & apos ; t just need < unk > or < unk > .
you do something that & apos ; s actually a little different .
it & apos ; s in between , and we think it & apos ; s changing the way information can be used .
now i want to take this idea a little bit further about what a little crazy is .
what we & apos ; ve done is we & apos ; ve taken down every single google search , and they & apos ; re reduced it to a little summary .
so the summary there & apos ; s a quick record and a symbol for the field that it comes from .
i & apos ; m just going to show the top 500 of the hit ones .
but even in that ugly view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we get the impression about the issues they & apos ; re on wikipedia .
i & apos ; m going to choose the government .
now , having chosen the government , i realize that the most < unk > time cover time is & quot ; people of the year . & quot ;
this is really important , because this is a finding that isn & apos ; t there in a single < unk > .
that & apos ; s just simply when you take a step back and you look at it .
i can take a certain set of these summaries , and i can take it back into the theme of time , & quot ; people of this year , & quot ; and everybody sees together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are < unk > , some of them are from science . some , less coming out of economics . here & apos ; s my boss , and one comes from the < unk > .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so , we can jump . and we can look at all the ted prize .
and you can see , we & apos ; re on the net for the first time , it & apos ; s actually a net , not just from page to page , but much more abstract .
so i want to show you something else that might be a surprise to this .
i & apos ; m just showing you the new york times website here .
< unk > , these application -- i don & apos ; t want to call it a browser ; it & apos ; s really not an browser , but you can look at websites with this -- and we get this < unk > website at every single website like this .
so i can take that step back and jump right to a specific blood cell .
this is important , because all the time you can look at web websites in this way , the whole , sort of , < unk > in the same way .
so , i can zoom in into a certain amount of time .
here & apos ; s the state of the whole demonstration that i & apos ; ve kept here .
and i can sort of < unk > on what i & apos ; ve seen so far , again .
and , again , if i come back to that and look at everything , i might < unk > my course , and this is where i looked for & apos ; < unk > & apos ; s & apos ; , here after money , or live here .
and from here i can get into the site and come back to it .
it & apos ; s a metaphor that & apos ; s used over and over again , and every time it makes the big picture greater than the sum of the ocean .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a test .
and we & apos ; re talking about the makes the < unk > .
we & apos ; re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could reverse this situation and turn the internet on its head so that instead of walking from one to the other , we & apos ; re going to start to start many things to many things , and , as a pattern , what kinds of patterns were going on ?
if we can do this , this is going to < unk > this past information , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving information , we can get knowledge from that .
and if we know , maybe we can actually pull through it .
i & apos ; ll stop . thank you .
i grew up in a < unk > portion of science fiction .
in my school , i was riding the bus to school every day , one hour per track .
and my nose was always set up in a book that < unk > my mind to other worlds and , in a way , i had deep in my < unk > , head of curiosity .
this curiosity also showed that i & apos ; m always , if i wasn & apos ; t in school , through the forests , i went around , & quot ; samples , & quot ; if i & apos ; d been collecting frogs and bugs , and everything by the microscope .
i was completely < unk > , you know .
it was all about trying to understand the world and the limits of the possible .
and my love went to science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late 60s , we flew to the moon and was exploring the deep sea .
jacques thing came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows us animals and places and a world full of wonder we & apos ; d never imagined before .
and that probably did good at that < unk > < unk > .
and i was an artist .
i would draw . i could paint .
and because there were no video games and these < unk > movies with < unk > and the whole imagery in the media environment , i had to create the paintings in my mind .
that & apos ; s what we all needed when we saw a book when we read a book , we took the description of the house and we put it on the screen in our heads .
my response was drawing on that and painting by aliens , aliens worlds , robots , < unk > , and all that kind of stuff .
i & apos ; ve been caught by teachers all the time , like me , hiding textbook , < unk > .
there was some creativity had to come out .
and something interesting happened , because i was fascinated by jacques < unk > shows , a whole unknown world on this planet itself .
i & apos ; m certainly going to ever get to a alien world at a spaceship . it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and it was just as fascinating , and exotic as all i had ever imagined to myself when i & apos ; d read those books .
so i decided when i was 15 , diver .
the only problem is i lived in a small village in canada , < unk > miles from the next ocean .
i didn & apos ; t get myself wrong .
i passed my father until finally he got a < unk > in buffalo in buffalo , new york , got on the other side of the line where we lived .
i put my < unk > in a pool of < unk > in the middle of the winter in buffalo in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , though , would have a real ocean , i & apos ; d only get two years later , when we moved to california .
it & apos ; s since , 40 years that & apos ; s now < unk > , so i spent about 25,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of it in < unk > .
and i & apos ; ve learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the < unk > oceans , is as rich as we can imagine .
nature & apos ; s imagination doesn & apos ; t know borders , very much in terms of our own , < unk > human imagination .
until this day , i feel really weird awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding the same intensity as ever .
so , as i turned out to be a grown profession , it was the off .
this seemed like the best way of < unk > my inner drive to tell stories , with my need to create images , images .
as a child i was always drawing comic books and all the time .
so films were off the road , images and stories , and that fit together .
of course , the stories i took were < unk > from the < unk > , the < unk > , & quot ; good . & quot ; aliens , & quot ; and & quot ; < unk > . & quot ;
in & quot ; the < unk > , & quot ; i was able to connect my preference for the < unk > , and this is connecting to the living something .
so love actually < unk > my two loves .
one interesting thing happened in & quot ; < unk > , & quot ; to solve a < unk > problem in this film -- that & apos ; s why we had to create a kind of liquid < unk > -- we & apos ; re putting ourselves back on < unk > , animation , animation .
and what came up with was the first < unk > < unk > that ever happened in a movie .
now the film didn & apos ; t make any money , in fact , he was playing just his < unk > , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on all over the world was < unk > by the magic .
you know , according to arthur they & apos ; re < unk > & apos ; s law , < unk > technology and < unk > are no longer different from each other .
so they saw the magical thing .
and that got me incredibly exciting .
and i thought to myself , & quot ; wow , that has got to be brought into < unk > . & quot ;
so , we went to & quot ; your : two , & quot ; my next movie , much further .
together with < unk > , we created the types of liquid metal . the success was pretty much about how this effect would get .
and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the impact in the audience was the same thing , but we & apos ; ve already made a little bit more money to it .
from those two experiences , a whole new world was done , a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company and i put together with my good friend back in those days , who was the best < unk > and < unk > . it was called & quot ; digital < unk > . & quot ;
and the basic idea of this company was to set up visual processes with visual processes and go right into the digital < unk > process .
so that & apos ; s what we did , and then again , is what we did for a while .
but in the mid- & apos ; 90s , we realized that we were growing in < unk > and < unk > -- which we actually set up the company -- slowly < unk > .
i had written this piece & quot ; avatar , & quot ; that the bar should be visual effects and < unk > effects in all these new heights , using deep characters , by using < unk > , and the world & apos ; s < unk > be < unk > .
but the bar got quite beautiful , and the people in my company told me we weren & apos ; t actually able to do it .
so i & apos ; m setting this up , and i made this film about the big ship , the get off .
i sold that as & quot ; romeo and julia on a ship & quot ; -- it became an < unk > agree , a passionate movie .
but actually , i wanted to meet the real < unk > of the titanic .
that & apos ; s why i made the film .
that & apos ; s the truth . and the studio didn & apos ; t know .
but i convinced you by saying , & quot ; we & apos ; re diving to the earth . we & apos ; re movies about this thing . we & apos ; re movies .
we & apos ; re going to show it in the < unk > of film .
that & apos ; s incredibly important . it & apos ; s a good < unk > for marketing . & quot ;
and i killed them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is also going back to how your imagination can create a reality .
we actually created a reality , then , six months later , where i went to a russian < unk > , < unk > miles under the surface of the north atlantic , watching the real titanic through a < unk > .
it wasn & apos ; t a movie . it wasn & apos ; t a < unk > , it was real .
well , that blew my mind .
and then they were huge -- we had to build cameras and house and all kinds of things .
and it occurred to me how much of these < unk > , a < unk > no doubt .
well , they were also < unk > and < unk > planning show .
you go up into that capsule , you & apos ; re kind of floating into this dark , < unk > environment , where there & apos ; s no hope for saving if you don & apos ; t make it back yourself .
and i was like , & quot ; wow , that & apos ; s the same thing as if i was in a < unk > business .
it & apos ; s really cool . & quot ;
i was literally obsessed with the study of the deep ocean .
anyway , the bit about curiosity and science was about it . it was everything . it was adventure ; it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and there was an experience that hollywood couldn & apos ; t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i was able to imagine a creature that we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn & apos ; t imagine what i would see outside the box .
some of the following expeditions i & apos ; ve seen in < unk > creatures , and sometimes things i & apos ; d never seen before , sometimes even things that no one had ever seen before and had seen for the science that time when we had not found them .
so it really < unk > me , and i wanted more .
and so i made a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of titanic , i said , & quot ; okay , i want to put my < unk > as a filmmaker in hollywood on the ice for a while . & quot ;
and then we started , and we started looking at & quot ; < unk > , & quot ; and they were exploring with < unk > .
we went back to the looked at the titanic .
we took little robots that we built that had an < unk > < unk > system .
our intent was to look at the space of the ship , and look at what had never been done before .
no one ever looked at the inside of the vehicle ; you didn & apos ; t have tools for it yet , so we & apos ; ve developed the technology .
well , i & apos ; m sitting there , on the titanic , on the titanic , in the titanic , and i & apos ; m looking at these < unk > , quite similar , and i know the band was playing there .
and i fly through a little < unk > through the < unk > of the ship .
i & apos ; m actually < unk > it , but my consciousness is in the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically on the inside of the titanic box .
this was a < unk > form of a < unk > i & apos ; ve ever experienced before , because before i looked around a corner , i & apos ; ve always known what & apos ; s going on in the < unk > of this vehicle , i & apos ; d been here for months as a < unk > movie .
the set of set was a straight copy of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me realize that you can use such < unk > < unk > , so your own consciousness in the vehicle , into that different form of existence .
it was really extremely profound .
and perhaps a little view of what might have happened in some decades when you & apos ; ve been able to study something to do or do other things , in all sorts of < unk > < unk > that i can think of as < unk > .
in these expeditions , we started to see what we looked at down there , really appreciate , for example , these < unk > , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help of < unk > .
they don & apos ; t exist in a sunlight system that we do .
and so you see animals , right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that they can survive there .
i was also interested in < unk > at the same time , and that was again , when i was a kid from my childhood .
and so i ended up looking at the people who are interested in space and doing with nasa , who are in class , and they & apos ; re going to be doing the right < unk > , and they & apos ; re going to go to russia , they & apos ; re going to go through russia , let go to the < unk > and do this talk , and do this talk , and < unk > .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of it , it occurred to me that i was taking control of ourselves in the deep sea .
i took them and i gave them access to the world : < unk > , < unk > people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources with them , and i could look at samples and test them , and test tools .
we & apos ; re driving , but we & apos ; re actually doing science , specifically , < unk > < unk > .
so the circle of my existence as a < unk > child at that time as a child , and the manifestation of reality .
and in the course of this voyage , i & apos ; ve learned a lot .
i & apos ; ve learned a lot about science , but now i & apos ; m sure you & apos ; re going to be a director , a leader , a leader , like a < unk > or something .
i didn & apos ; t understand a whole lot of leadership before i get these expeditions .
because at one point i had to say , & quot ; what am i doing here ?
why do i do this ? what & apos ; s going to come out of it ? & quot ;
these films in movies don & apos ; t bring money to us .
we & apos ; re playing the < unk > . of fame , there & apos ; s no trace .
everybody thinks i was & quot ; titanic & quot ; and & quot ; avatar , & quot ; and i had thrown the nails on a towel somewhere on a towel .
i have all these movies , these ones that are making a very small audience for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you do it by the will to match the will -- and the ocean is the most < unk > environment that & apos ; s out there . you make it on the < unk > for , and because of the weird connection that comes out when a small group of people .
because we & apos ; ve all done this with just 10 to 12 people who & apos ; ve been < unk > years , sometimes we & apos ; ve had two to three months in a row .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing that you have is the most important thing you have in front of each other , because you have a task that you can & apos ; t understand .
when you go back to land and you say , & quot ; we had to do it , the < unk > , the < unk > , and all around it , the whole technology , and the difficulties that are the human show , if you don & apos ; t work on the lake . & quot ;
there & apos ; s a connection there , a personal respect .
so when i got back to my next film & quot ; avatar , & quot ; i tried to apply that same leadership , which is that you respect your team and < unk > in return of their respect .
it really changed the dynamic .
so i stood again with a small team on the < unk > terrain . we made & quot ; with a new technology that was not there before .
incredibly exciting .
it & apos ; s an enormous challenge .
and we were , for a < unk > period , to be one < unk > family .
and it has changed my way of making movies completely .
there were people who thought we & apos ; d actually transported these < unk > , which was really good < unk > and on the planet .
for me , it & apos ; s been more a conceptual way of doing my job , the actual process that changed .
so what can we get out of all this ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think the first thing is curiosity .
it & apos ; s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force even a reality .
and the epidemic of your team is more important than all the world & apos ; s < unk > .
they come to me young filmmakers who say , & quot ; give me a advice to how i can do something like this . & quot ;
and i & apos ; m like , & quot ; don & apos ; t < unk > yourself .
it gets others for you . don & apos ; t do it yourself , don & apos ; t bet against itself , but take risks for you . & quot ;
nasa has a civil war like that : & quot ; failure is not alternative . & quot ;
but in art , and i think it & apos ; s got to be a failure , because that & apos ; s where it < unk > .
no important endeavor that innovation was called , ever without risk .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
so that & apos ; s the idea that i & apos ; d like to leave you with , and we don & apos ; t want to -- failure is an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i am talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise you , because my work in the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , to make the things we invent and need to enable the poorest two billion more life .
but energy and climate is extremely important to these people , actually , more important than anyone else on the planet .
< unk > means that whose < unk > don & apos ; t grow over many years , it & apos ; s too little or too little rain . things are going to change as much as it can & apos ; t sustain your fragile environment .
this leads to < unk > . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and also , the most important thing for them is critical .
in fact , if you could reduce just one thing the price , energy by far the most effective .
well , the result has fallen over time .
in fact , < unk > is based on < unk > .
the < unk > had the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a fast case in the < unk > , and so we & apos ; ve made refrigerators < unk > , we can make modern materials , and we & apos ; re doing so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation with power in the rich world .
but if we & apos ; re going to reduce the price -- let & apos ; s try to cut the price in half -- let & apos ; s meet a new barrier , and the barrier is up to co2 .
co2 causes the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
it & apos ; s < unk > the < unk > co2 , which leads to the < unk > , and < unk > has some very negative effects . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , that means that the natural ecosystems can & apos ; t adapt to changes and so on .
now , the exact same context between a < unk > and , by that , is < unk > < unk > , and where the other effects are , there & apos ; s some pretty good ones , but not very many .
and there are surely to think about how bad these implications are , but they & apos ; re going to be extremely bad !
so i asked the < unk > several times , & quot ; do we really need to get down to zero ?
enough , how about half a quarter ? & quot ;
the answer is , until we get near zero , it & apos ; s going to go to temperature .
so it & apos ; s a very challenging challenge .
it & apos ; s very different from saying we & apos ; ve got a < unk > truck that has to get under a < unk > bridge , and then you can just cut them down .
that & apos ; s got to go at the bottom , to zero .
now , we & apos ; re adding a lot of < unk > , over 26 billion tons a year .
every american is about 20 tons . people in poor countries , less than one .
on average , it & apos ; s about five tons of every on the planet .
and somehow we need to bring changes that down to zero .
it & apos ; s up all the time .
there are only different economic changes that have at all , and we have to go from $ < unk > increase , and go to a reduction to zero .
this equation has four different factors . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- co2 that you want to get towards zero , and that & apos ; s going to depend on the number of people from the service that everyone is using on average , average , the average energy for co2 and service .
so let & apos ; s look at each factor at each one , and let & apos ; s see how we get this to zero .
probably one of those numbers has got to get very close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let & apos ; s take it through .
first we have the population .
today , < unk > billion people live .
and it & apos ; s based on nine billion species of research that are going down to nine billion .
if we & apos ; re very successful with vaccines , the < unk > and < unk > , we & apos ; d be able to cut that down by 10 percent or 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope at 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it & apos ; s whatever food we eat , clothes , television , heat .
these are very good things , and < unk > , which means you get this services almost everyone on the planet .
it & apos ; s great that number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do < unk > and use less , but on average , that number is going to go up every year and double more than doubled the number of services per person is being put on .
and here we see a very basic service . is there any way to light in order for you to read the homework ?
and these students don & apos ; t have it , so they go out and they read their < unk > underneath the window .
now , with efficiency , with e , energy per service , there & apos ; s finally good news .
we have something that doesn & apos ; t go up .
so because of different successes in the < unk > , through other forms of time , through new methods in < unk > , there are a lot of services whose energy some services go through 90 percent .
in other service , like the production of < unk > , 105 < unk > : < unk > < unk > -- & amp ; amp ; < unk > . < unk > : < unk > , or the < unk > < unk > one , is far smaller .
in total , if we are optimistic , maybe we will get a reduction in reduction by a factor of three or maybe even six times .
but in the first three things that we & apos ; ve gone from 26 billion to maybe 13 billion tons of < unk > , and that & apos ; s just not enough !
so , let & apos ; s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that & apos ; s the amount of co2 that & apos ; s going to grow energy .
it & apos ; s a question of if you can get this down to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every < unk > that we have with electricity today , apart from renewables and energy production .
so , what we need to do on a global level is create a new system .
we need < unk > .
now , when i use the term & quot ; miracle , & quot ; i don & apos ; t mean the impossible .
the count is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the internet and services , it & apos ; s a miracle .
people here have contributed to a lot of these wonder .
don & apos ; t usually have a < unk > that you need a miracle till a particular date .
usually it & apos ; s just about to get next to some , some won & apos ; t .
but in this case , we have to have some < unk > and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i actually deliver this ?
is there a natural < unk > , a demonstration that < unk > people & apos ; s imagination ?
i remembered this last year when i took mosquitoes and kind of liked people .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people with mosquitoes .
for energy , it occurred to me .
i decided that & apos ; s my expensive contribution to the environment here .
so , here are some natural fireflies .
i was told that she didn & apos ; t bite . in fact , she & apos ; re not going to take the glass .
well , there are all kinds of < unk > like this , but they don & apos ; t get much .
we need solutions , either one or more , have an unimaginable scaling and unimaginable < unk > , and even though there are many directions where people go looking after that , i really see five , which can afford those big demands .
i have students , < unk > , fusion and biofuels .
that & apos ; s a < unk > contribution , and if you & apos ; re in a better way than i expect it would be great , but i think my cool here is that we need to work on all five , and we can not give up any of them , because they & apos ; re limited issues .
let & apos ; s look at the first burning fossil fuels , < unk > of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is just not , but it & apos ; s not . you have to have to have all the co2 that comes out of the < unk > , get out of the pressure , get under pressure , and then hope , and you hope it be there .
there are some < unk > that are getting that on a 60 percent level -- 80 percent level , but it & apos ; ll get it very difficult to do , and an agreement that & apos ; s built out for co2 , but it & apos ; s a huge challenge here .
who & apos ; s going to make it sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally can be made of billions of times greater than any kind of garbage that you can imagine from simple < unk > and other things ?
that & apos ; s a lot of volume .
so it & apos ; s a tough resource .
next , < unk > .
it & apos ; s got three big problems too . the cost , especially in < unk > countries , the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human < unk > that it & apos ; s not used for guns .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it isn & apos ; t very large , there & apos ; s a lot to think about .
so three very difficult issues that might be overcome , and therefore you should work on .
the last three of them i & apos ; ve summarized .
it & apos ; s renewables , as they often call them .
and also they have -- although it & apos ; s great that they don & apos ; t need a fuel -- they have some thank you .
one is the energy that & apos ; s driving these technologies dramatically lower than by power .
these are < unk > , you & apos ; re talking about a lot of < unk > , 1,000 times more space than an ordinary power station .
and then we have these sources that come from around .
the sun doesn & apos ; t seem to be all day , it doesn & apos ; t seem to be well every day , and it doesn & apos ; t rise to the wind all the time .
so , if you & apos ; re going to depend on these sources , you know , have a way to get the energy in times when it & apos ; s not available .
so there & apos ; s a lot of < unk > there . there are challenges in the transmission . so , for example , if we say the source of this country is outside the country , you don & apos ; t just need to deal with the risk , that the energy of where is different .
and there & apos ; s the < unk > thing .
and to show the dimension , i have all the kinds of batteries that are produced : those for cars , computers , cell phones , < unk > , for everything . and i & apos ; ve been using the amount of electronic energy that we & apos ; re producing as compared to the world .
so what we need here is a huge breakthrough , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approaches in time .
that & apos ; s not impossible , but it & apos ; s not that easy .
that & apos ; s what happens when you try to get those < unk > sources about say 20 percent -- 30 percent of consumption .
if you want to survive by about 100 percent , you need an incredible < unk > .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
a & quot ; manhattan project & quot ; ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of them .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many , you will say , they & apos ; re crazy . that & apos ; s good .
i think there are many of you in the ted group here that are already engaged in this group .
bill gross has several companies , among other things called < unk > , which is great , < unk > .
< unk > < unk > are investing in dozens of companies that have great things and interesting opportunities , and i & apos ; m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company that & apos ; s maybe very surprisingly , is tracking a nuclear approach to nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the < unk > ; they & apos ; re liquid .
and the evolution of development stopped in this industry a while ago , so there & apos ; s no surprise there & apos ; s a few good concepts lying around .
the < unk > means that instead of any part of the brain , one percent , the one percent , the < unk > , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the < unk > .
that & apos ; s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you & apos ; d been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never simulate whether it was going to work , but it & apos ; s been modern , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right < unk > , it looks like it & apos ; s gone .
and because you burn up with this 99 percent , it & apos ; s very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use waste of today & apos ; s use as a < unk > .
instead of going through my head , they & apos ; ll just burn it . there & apos ; s a great thing to do .
so the uranium is used , a little bit like a candle .
you see , it & apos ; s a kind of column , often called & quot ; < unk > wave . & quot ;
that really solve the < unk > .
there & apos ; s an image of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent . you have the one that & apos ; s being burned today , so it & apos ; s called < unk > uranium .
the build system for the u.s. military , hundreds of years .
and if you & apos ; re making < unk > cheap and < unk > , you & apos ; ll get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are still a lot of challenges , but there & apos ; s one example of a lot of concepts that we need to get forward .
let & apos ; s think about how we should measure our success .
what should we look like today ?
now , let & apos ; s go up to the goal that we have to reach and then talk about the < unk > .
many people respond to 80 percent by an 80 percent .
it & apos ; s very important for us to get there .
the other 20 percent are produced in the poor countries , and they & apos ; re still doing agriculture , hopefully it & apos ; s going to be clean , and hopefully it & apos ; s going to be clean and clean .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including china , is completely < unk > .
the other note says , are we using the < unk > technology , whether it & apos ; s deployed in all over the developed world , and we & apos ; re on the road to get it to the rest .
that & apos ; s great .
this is going to be a key shift .
if we go back from there , what should we look like in 2020 ?
i think it should be able to contain the two elements .
we should use < unk > to get reduction in the direction , and the less we & apos ; re going to be , the less we & apos ; re going to be the < unk > , and so it will also < unk > the temperature .
but in fact , this grade for the things we company , which don & apos ; t lead completely to the great < unk > , only the same , or even less important , like the other , which is the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs we need to track down to < unk > , and we can measure that : in < unk > , in < unk > and < unk > .
there are many great books on this topic .
al gore & apos ; s book & quot ; we have a choice & quot ; and david < unk > & apos ; s & quot ; < unk > energy content < unk > the off air air . & quot ;
they & apos ; re really going to come in and they & apos ; re creating a frame that can address this , because we need help from all sides .
there & apos ; s a lot that & apos ; s come together .
that is a wish .
and a very real true wish is that we & apos ; re inventing this technology .
if you just choose a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is a < unk > , < unk > carbon dioxide , that i & apos ; m making this desire .
this has the greatest impact .
if we don & apos ; t get that wish , we & apos ; re going to dig the dig in the long term between the u.s. and china , between the poor and the rich , and almost all the life of those two billion people will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what are the policies that i & apos ; ve done ?
we need to use more research .
when countries are meeting in places like < unk > , they shouldn & apos ; t just talk about co2 .
you want to discuss that gap , and you were shocked by the ridiculous ways that these innovative approaches are being spent .
we need < unk > , co2 taxes , < unk > & amp ; amp ; trade to get some < unk > .
we need to spread the news .
we have to have dialogue that are going through and full and also the things that are done by government .
it & apos ; s a big wish , but i think we can fulfill him .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just for understanding a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : in order to get the simulation on a operation , get all the big scientists , what we & apos ; ve done , we only need a few million . and even if we & apos ; ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it & apos ; s safe , just millions .
the hard step is to build the first < unk > , find other billions , the < unk > and the place that & apos ; s actually building the first of it .
once the first thing is done , if it & apos ; s as if it & apos ; s as if it & apos ; s ok , it & apos ; s the amount of energy we & apos ; re familiar with , it & apos ; s the way we & apos ; ve ever seen it .
to understand that , that means building in the ground , almost like a vertical nuclear bomb , that time goes by , and then this < unk > , and then it starts moving up and down ?
< unk > : right . now the reactor always have to < unk > the reactor , so there are a lot of people and a lot of people who can go wrong . this thing where you & apos ; re opening it and < unk > it , or < unk > it & apos ; s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it on for 60 years -- think of a column -- who buried it , without the full < unk > .
and it sits there and it & apos ; s 60 years and then it & apos ; s done .
it & apos ; s a < unk > which offers a solution to the trash .
< unk > : yeah . now what happens to the waste : you can sit at them -- there & apos ; s much waste with this method -- then take them and put it in the next reactor and burn it up .
and we & apos ; re starting by taking waste that & apos ; s already there that & apos ; s already in these < unk > or < unk > of reactors . that & apos ; s our use of design .
so what these reactors were a problem for these reactors , what we & apos ; re filling in our mind , and it & apos ; s going to reduce < unk > dramatically during this process .
but as you & apos ; re talking to different people in the world about these possibilities .
where & apos ; s the greatest interest in making this really happen ?
< unk > : now we haven & apos ; t set ourselves on a place , and there & apos ; s a lot of interesting < unk > for everything that & apos ; s called the & quot ; < unk > & quot ; in the name . there & apos ; s a big interest and the people in india , i & apos ; ve been here in russia .
i & apos ; m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese have made a difference .
this is a version of a thing that & apos ; s made .
this is a big step forward , but it & apos ; s like a faster reactor and some countries built this , so everybody who has made a fast reactor , a computer network for our first .
in their mind , time and chance to really come to life ?
< unk > : well , we need one of these < unk > , < unk > things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then to use 20 years .
that & apos ; s kind of the < unk > that & apos ; s given to us about the < unk > that we need to < unk > .
and , you know , < unk > , if everything & apos ; s fine , and that & apos ; s a big wish , that may make it easy .
and fortunately today there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of , the ones that work as well , when the approaches , the market for their pilot , can < unk > .
and it & apos ; s best if it & apos ; s creating multiple , because then you could put a mix in .
anyway , we need a solution .
now , the most powerful possible breakthroughs is this the biggest thing you & apos ; re familiar with ?
< unk > : a < unk > is the most important .
it would have been without the < unk > , but it & apos ; s more important than that .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don & apos ; t know their work as well as this , but there & apos ; s the earlier approach , which is a different approach .
there & apos ; s a liquid < unk > that seems a little difficult , but maybe that & apos ; s what we & apos ; re talking about .
and so there & apos ; s different , but the beauty of this is that a < unk > has a million times as much energy as we do , say , a < unk > and therefore , if you deal with the issues , and the radiation , the cost of the scale , the scale .
if that doesn & apos ; t work , then what ?
do we have to make < unk > to try to keep the < unk > stable ?
< unk > : when you come to this situation , it & apos ; s like you ate too much , and , just before you have a heart attack , what do you do ? what do you need is a < unk > or something like that .
there & apos ; s a group of artists called < unk > that deal with various techniques in order to < unk > warming , so that we & apos ; ll get 20 or 30 years longer to < unk > .
that & apos ; s just a difference of opinion .
you hope we don & apos ; t need that .
some people say you don & apos ; t want to work on insurance because you & apos ; re likely to be lazy , so you & apos ; re eating because you know you & apos ; re going to save your < unk > .
i don & apos ; t know if this is smart , when you get the importance of this problem , but there & apos ; s now a discourse in < unk > about whether you & apos ; ve got to get this , if things go faster or that innovation needs longer than we want .
< unk > : do you have one or two sentences to convince you ?
< unk > : well , unfortunately , the skeptic for each other in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
say there & apos ; s negative effects to have to do with the clouds that move things around ?
there & apos ; s very , very few things that you can even tell , of which there & apos ; s a chance in a million .
the standard model here is very similar to aids .
you make errors now , and you pay for that a lot later .
and so the idea is that , now , if you have all kinds of < unk > problems , to invest in something you & apos ; ve only done -- and the thing that comes out is that the investment isn & apos ; t so clear . it & apos ; s actually not the worst thing that it is in the world .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time the co2 , the co2 also says , & quot ; hey , i don & apos ; t care that it & apos ; s not a carbon < unk > , i don & apos ; t know it & apos ; m going to accept it because it & apos ; s a fake . & quot ; s a < unk > .
and that would be their answer to the < unk > argument that if you use all the time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffering , the < unk > , the < unk > , the malaria , the malaria of malaria and so on , is a great waste of money .
< unk > : well , the actual spending of the research -- let & apos ; s say the u.s. air force should spend 10 billion dollars a year more than they do today -- it & apos ; s not that dramatic .
it & apos ; s not to other things under that .
it & apos ; s then you get to a lot of < unk > , and there are some people who disagree with something that isn & apos ; t economically , and you try to finance it -- most of what & apos ; s going on for me is most waste .
unless you & apos ; re very short in front of an < unk > and only fund the learning curve , and i think we should try to make more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if you get the < unk > that you get , it & apos ; s very high < unk > , then only you can keep the rich up .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing their lifestyle .
for the lower two billion , but it & apos ; s a disaster .
and even < unk > think so .
his new < unk > now is this : & quot ; why isn & apos ; t scientists talking more ? & quot ;
it & apos ; s always associated with his earlier stories , which is associated with the < unk > , but he has understood that it & apos ; s a very rare group , and that & apos ; s why he & apos ; s now < unk > .
and that & apos ; s a < unk > that i think is appropriate .
research , it & apos ; s just nuts , how little it & apos ; s going to support .
bill , i think i & apos ; m talking for almost all the people here when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
< unk > : thank you .
a few years ago at ted , peter < unk > introduced a < unk > show called & quot ; the < unk > . & quot ;
the idea is pretty simple . < unk > has to build the highest < unk > structure that & apos ; s about 20 degrees , about a meter tape , about a match and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow had to be on top .
and , although it really seems really simple , it & apos ; s actually pretty hard because people work very quickly .
and so i thought , this is an interesting idea , and i & apos ; ve turned it into a < unk > .
it was a huge success .
since then , i & apos ; ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , designers and architects , even with < unk > , and there & apos ; s something about this task , which creates deep sensations in the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of it with you .
normally , most people normally start to work on their own terms .
you talk about what you & apos ; re going to look like , what it & apos ; s going to look like .
and then you invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . you need to < unk > and try .
they & apos ; re investing a lot of their time into the < unk > and < unk > structures all the time .
and finally , before you don & apos ; t have time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and they set them gently back at the top , step back and & quot ; < unk > , & quot ; admire your work .
but what & apos ; s next , almost always , is that the & quot ; < unk > & quot ; becomes a & quot ; < unk > , & quot ; because the weight of the planet causes the whole thing to do and < unk > .
there are a number of people who have done a lot more & quot ; < unk > & quot ; than others , and in the worst place these are fresh water types .
they lie , they cheat , they & apos ; re confused , they & apos ; re really creating < unk > shapes .
and , of course , there are teams who have many more & quot ; < unk > & quot ; brought in and the best boys are fresh graduate students in the house .
and that & apos ; s pretty amazing .
so , as peter told us , they & apos ; re not just the highest towers of towers , they & apos ; re also the most interesting structures of all .
what you may be asking : how is this coming ? why ? what is it ?
and peter : don & apos ; t spend any of the kids spend time in that spaghetti sauce of spaghetti sauce .
they & apos ; re not investing in < unk > all the time .
but there is one more reason .
and that is that < unk > have been trained to find the right plan , right ?
and he went to realize .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , they don & apos ; t have time and what & apos ; s happening ?
it & apos ; s a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what < unk > are doing is they & apos ; re starting to start with the marshmallow and they & apos ; re building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top so that they have the multiple < unk > prototypes to fix .
and < unk > recognize this way of working together as a core < unk > .
and trying to bring the children directly feedback that works and doesn & apos ; t work .
so the achievement , working with prototypes , is a lot -- but let & apos ; s see how different teams do .
average rate for most of that is about < unk > , < unk > creating half of it , lawyers a little more , but it & apos ; s not much , much more difficult than adults .
who is at the most successful ?
architects and engineers , < unk > .
three , it & apos ; s the highest thing i & apos ; ve seen .
and why ? because they understand and < unk > educated , are the key to build stable structures .
penguins are on average . but here it gets interesting .
you put an < unk > talking on your team , they get significantly better .
it & apos ; s amazing . you can see around and recognize this team , this team is going to win . & quot ;
you can predict the predict . why is that ?
because they have special set of skills .
they pass the process . they understand him .
and this team that & apos ; s coming in and paying attention to the work is going to dramatically improve the performance of the team .
specialized skills and < unk > and < unk > are the combination of success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , the stable structures .
so i tried something interesting .
i thought we & apos ; ll bring the same < unk > .
so i offered a $ < unk > price of software for the winners .
what did you think happened to those < unk > ?
what was that result ?
this was happening . not a team had stable structure .
if anyone had built a < unk > tape , he would have paid the price back home .
so isn & apos ; t it interesting that huge levels of effect have a strong effect ?
we went through this exercise of same student .
what do you think was happening ?
now , you understand the advantage of & quot ; prototyping . & quot ;
this is how the same , bad team of one under the best .
it produced the highest architecture in terms of time .
there & apos ; s < unk > lessons for us , about nature & apos ; s nature of machine drive and success .
you might ask , why would anyone actually invest a time to create a financial firm ?
the reason is i & apos ; m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and < unk > < unk > .
and what the < unk > does is it helps you identify what the hidden assumptions is .
because open up , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , or yes , to build the right prototype .
and this is worth the value of that experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who care , you can go to < unk > .
i mean , it & apos ; s a blog where you see the ted stage .
there & apos ; s a < unk > there .
they find crazy examples from all around the world like people optimize the system and < unk > .
and this is also < unk > .
and the most interesting lesson , i think , is the design of the design that & apos ; s actually a < unk > sport .
it demands that we & apos ; re all focusing on the task and that we & apos ; re using what we & apos ; re doing is our thinking and what we & apos ; re doing in the challenge that & apos ; s in front of us .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all it takes to get us away from a & quot ; < unk > & quot ; -- to a & quot ; moment of moment . & quot ;
and that can make a huge difference .
thank you .
we pretend that we have one machine .
it & apos ; s a big machine . it & apos ; s a cool machine , it & apos ; s a time machine .
and everybody in this room needs to go in .
and you can go in the past , you can go to the future ; you can & apos ; t stay there and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i & apos ; ve asked my friends this question a lot lately , and they wanted to go to the past all the time .
i don & apos ; t know . they wanted to go back in time before there were cars or twitter or & quot ; america is looking for the superstar . & quot ;
i don & apos ; t know .
i believe that you & apos ; re sort of drawn to < unk > , to < unk > .
and i understand that .
i & apos ; m not a part of this group , i have to say .
i don & apos ; t want to go into the past , and that & apos ; s not because i & apos ; m a peace game .
it & apos ; s because opportunities on this planet don & apos ; t go forward , they move forward .
so , i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that happened on this planet , no matter what scale it is : health , wealth , wealth , opportunities , declining , declining < unk > .
there has never been a time like this .
my < unk > died all when they were 60 .
my grandparents cover that number at 70 .
my parents are 80 on the < unk > .
so there & apos ; s going to be a nine on the verge of mine .
but it & apos ; s not even about people like us , because that & apos ; s a bigger thing than that .
a child born in new delhi today will expect to live as long as the richest man on the planet 100 years ago .
think about it . that & apos ; s an incredible fact .
now why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed some people on the planet .
they & apos ; ve raised the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
gone . they have disappeared . they have disappeared .
we called them & quot ; < unk > . & quot ;
in the rich world , diseases exist only one generation against one generation of us , hardly at all .
< unk > , < unk > , < unk > ...
anyone remember what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the successes of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method to try things out , see if it works , if it doesn & apos ; t do that , is one of the greatest achievements of mankind .
so that & apos ; s the good news .
unfortunately , it & apos ; s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they & apos ; ve been mentioned quite often .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , there & apos ; s a billion people in the world going to bed hungry every day .
that number goes up , and it goes up very fast , and that & apos ; s embarrassing .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to < unk > this world .
drinking water , < unk > country , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , soon , and if we don & apos ; t get out of this chaos , we & apos ; re going to disappear .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think so .
i think it & apos ; s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn & apos ; t destroy them simultaneously .
i really think that , and no , that & apos ; s not a < unk > .
but that & apos ; s what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that i & apos ; m awake at night -- we & apos ; ve never yet to make scientific progress any more or less .
and we & apos ; ve never been able to get him sensible , just like we can do today .
we & apos ; re at the threshold , incredible events on many sites , and i really think we have to go back 100 , 300 years ago to find a time that we & apos ; ve fighting in progress that we & apos ; ve met these things more than we & apos ; ve < unk > .
people were < unk > themselves in their faith , and so closely , you can & apos ; t let them out .
not even the truth will set them free .
and listen , everyone has a right to his mind ; he & apos ; s actually right to his mind for progress .
but you know what they & apos ; re not right about ?
they & apos ; re not right for their own facts , & quot ; < unk > , they don & apos ; t .
and i took a while to figure this out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about wouldn & apos ; t have written & quot ; the new yorker , & quot ; a little article .
and i was amazed at resistance , toward the resistance of what ended up being the most effective in health care in human health history .
i didn & apos ; t know what to do , so i just what i always do , i wrote an article and continued .
and soon i was writing a piece on over time changed the food industry .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about this , and i couldn & apos ; t understand why people thought it was & quot ; < unk > , & quot ; why they believed that molecules in certain random rather than random a random kind of random put in nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i continued .
i mean , i & apos ; m a journalist .
we & apos ; re typing , we & apos ; re join , we & apos ; re eating food , that & apos ; s okay .
but i was worried about this article , and i couldn & apos ; t figure out why , and finally i found it .
and that & apos ; s because these < unk > that were going mad at all .
these were < unk > people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that & apos ; s what brought me up to ...
but then i thought , you know what , let & apos ; s face it .
we & apos ; ve come to a point where we don & apos ; t have the same relationship with progress as we used to .
we & apos ; re talking < unk > of it .
we & apos ; re talking ironic about this , little quote , & quot ; progress . & quot ;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what reasons these are .
we have the confidence in institutions , in authority , and then we have lost in science , and there is no reason why this should not be so .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , < unk > , the < unk > , < unk > , weapons of mass destruction , the < unk > 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed that they were always right . so be them skeptical .
ask a question , ask the evidence , ask the evidence .
take nothing for granted .
but here it is : when you get the evidence , you & apos ; ve got to adopt these evidence , and we & apos ; re not too good at it .
and i can say that because we & apos ; re now in an epidemic of fear , like i & apos ; ve never seen them before , and hopefully i & apos ; ll never see them again .
about 12 years ago , a story came out , a terrible story , a terrible story , that brought the < unk > to it , < unk > vaccine , and < unk > vaccine .
very frightening .
hundreds of studies were conducted to see if that was true .
hundreds of studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data started coming in .
they came in from the u.s. , from britain , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn & apos ; t make any difference . it doesn & apos ; t make a difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what makes us feel very comfortable .
we don & apos ; t believe in a whole bunch of < unk > documents that give us data , and i understand that , i think we & apos ; re all doing .
but you know what ?
the result of that was devastating .
it & apos ; s because of the fact that the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the information crisis is going down .
this is < unk > , and we should be ashamed .
it & apos ; s bad .
what & apos ; s happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
now , did anybody think there ?
did a single one in the audience ever see someone die of need ?
you don & apos ; t very often .
it doesn & apos ; t happen in this country at all , but up to new york times in the world last year .
that & apos ; s a lot of deaths through them , 20 per hour .
but because this didn & apos ; t happen , we can take it in denial , and people like jenny can walk in and through messages of platforms like oprah and larry king .
and they can do that because they can & apos ; t connect and correlation .
they don & apos ; t understand that these things seem the same , but almost never be the same .
and that & apos ; s something we need to learn , and that & apos ; s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas < unk > .
it < unk > us from one of the worst < unk > in mankind .
no fear , no < unk > , < unk > , disappeared .
that guy in the middle doesn & apos ; t look that much .
it & apos ; s called paul < unk > .
he & apos ; s just evolved with a few other people in the world .
he can save the lives of < unk > , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn & apos ; t it ?
well , that & apos ; s good , besides the fact that paul has taken and talks about vaccines and says how valuable are they and that people should just stop < unk > .
and that & apos ; s what he actually says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul is speaking in a public health worker , he can & apos ; t tell you about no armed television .
gets calls back home because people like to tell him that they know where their kids go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don & apos ; t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
take it off , turn back the diseases , terrible diseases , and that & apos ; s happening .
this is a country that we & apos ; ve put in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die back to that , because that & apos ; s just one question of numbers .
and they & apos ; re not just going to die of them .
what about counting ? let & apos ; s take this . why not ?
a recent shot of me just a couple of weeks ago , and i & apos ; m going to say i & apos ; m a little bit < unk > .
no one said that before .
she wouldn & apos ; t < unk > their child at all . absolutely not .
fine .
why ? because we don & apos ; t have < unk > . and you know what ?
we had no < unk > in this country yesterday .
today , i don & apos ; t know , maybe tomorrow somebody in lagos came into an airplane , and just going to los angeles , right now it & apos ; s about ohio .
and in a couple of hours , he lands , and he ends up in a car , and he comes to long beach , and he becomes one of these < unk > < unk > tonight .
and he doesn & apos ; t know that he & apos ; s got to get infected with an innocent disease , and we don & apos ; t know , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don & apos ; t do it like it isn & apos ; t .
we love to lie . we love it . we love it .
did you all take your vitamins this morning ?
< unk > , a little < unk > that helps them get over .
i know they did that because half the american people are doing it every day .
they take stuff , and they take alternative cure , and there & apos ; s no difference in how often we find out they & apos ; re useless .
the data shows this all the time .
it < unk > their urine . more don & apos ; t do nearly anything .
that & apos ; s okay , you & apos ; d like to have 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you that totally .
you & apos ; re dark . dark .
why are we doing that ? why are we doing it ?
now , i think i understand -- we hate the medical industry .
we hate a strong government . we don & apos ; t have trust in the system .
and that & apos ; s not what we need to do . our healthcare system is dna .
it & apos ; s cruel to millions of people .
it & apos ; s absolutely amazing to have cold , and it & apos ; s too < unk > ourselves who can afford it .
so we & apos ; re going away from this , and where are we going ?
we & apos ; re going into the arms of the crisis .
that & apos ; s great . i love < unk > < unk > .
but you know , it & apos ; s really serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we & apos ; re spending billions and billions of dollars on this .
and i have all kinds of little < unk > here .
none of those -- < unk > , fraud , was , < unk > , < unk > , i don & apos ; t even know what this is , but we & apos ; re spending billions of dollars on that ; it was .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream up and say , & quot ; why don & apos ; t you care ? let people do what they want .
that & apos ; s how you feel good . & quot ;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because it doesn & apos ; t care to me whether it & apos ; s the < unk > saying , & quot ; hmm , i & apos ; m not going to accept the evidence of my research , & quot ; or any < unk > that will treat his patients with < unk > .
if you & apos ; re on the way to which belief and magic and science replace it , you & apos ; re going to go to a place where you don & apos ; t want to be .
they get to < unk > < unk > in south africa .
he took 400,000 of his people , because he insisted that red < unk > , < unk > , and < unk > are much more effective than drugs , which we know can < unk > the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of deaths in one country that & apos ; s worse than any other type of disease ever gets < unk > .
don & apos ; t tell me that those things don & apos ; t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the most common epidemic that we & apos ; re in right now is this < unk > struggle between the < unk > foods and the food industry .
that & apos ; s a great debate . it has to stop .
it & apos ; s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that & apos ; s ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every < unk > , every branch we eat , every < unk > , is changed by the people .
you know , there was no < unk > in paradise .
there were no < unk > back .
there was no < unk > . we did all that .
we did it in the last five thousand years .
and some of it worked , some of it didn & apos ; t work .
we got rid of what has not worked .
now we can do it more closely . and of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to extend millions of people to their lives .
don & apos ; t you want to do that ?
i have to say , i don & apos ; t understand .
we refuse to change food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear all the time is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we don & apos ; t want to < unk > , one thing that & apos ; s wrong .
we don & apos ; t want companies to patent life .
we don & apos ; t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yeah , they were right . we figure that out .
it & apos ; s true we have a huge problem of science , but that & apos ; s not science .
there & apos ; s nothing to do with science .
it & apos ; s right , morality , < unk > .
they know that science is not a company .
it & apos ; s not a country .
it & apos ; s not even an idea ; it & apos ; s a process .
it & apos ; s a process , and sometimes it doesn & apos ; t work and sometimes it doesn & apos ; t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do your work because we have a real < unk > and it & apos ; s holding millions of people away from people .
you know , in the next 50 years we & apos ; ll have to grow 70 percent more food , right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we & apos ; re not giving them .
and why ? < unk > changed food .
we don & apos ; t want to encourage people to eat this < unk > stuff , like < unk > .
< unk > is something that & apos ; s half a billion people eat .
it & apos ; s kind of like a potato .
it & apos ; s just a whole bunch of diet . it & apos ; s legal .
it doesn & apos ; t have nutrients , it doesn & apos ; t have protein , and scientists do all that in it now .
and then people could eat this and they wouldn & apos ; t be blind .
you wouldn & apos ; t be able to fight , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn & apos ; t be < unk > < unk > , but it would be beautiful .
and all the things i can say about this is , why are we fighting this ?
i mean , let & apos ; s ask : why are we fighting this ?
because we don & apos ; t want to < unk > genes ?
it & apos ; s not about < unk > genes . it & apos ; s not about chemicals .
it & apos ; s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our job for larger food , better food , animal food .
it & apos ; s not < unk > , it & apos ; s about keeping people alive , and it & apos ; s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don & apos ; t do that , if we keep doing something like this , we & apos ; re getting guilty of something we & apos ; re thinking we don & apos ; t want to be guilty , high-tech people .
there is no other description for what & apos ; s going on .
it & apos ; s selfish , it & apos ; s ugly , it & apos ; s not worthy , and we really have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , & quot ; do you still want to go to these ridiculous time machine and go to the future ? & quot ;
anyway . that & apos ; s what i would like .
right now , it & apos ; s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine up to everything that we want .
we can < unk > them where we want to put them on top of it , and we & apos ; re going to move them around where we want to .
we have to have those conversations , and we have to think , but if we go inside the time machine and go into the future , we & apos ; re going to be happy to make it .
i know we can do it , and as far as i & apos ; m concerned this is something that needs the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
some of the time , i & apos ; ve been interested in the < unk > , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because if you look at it in the way i consider , as & quot ; a deception that & apos ; s really true , if you just believe in it . & quot ;
in other words , < unk > have shown some studies of some of the studies , the < unk > , which is why the person thinks what & apos ; s happening to her is a < unk > or a kind of ... in the < unk > , if there & apos ; s even the patient .
a deception becomes a real true experience because somebody likes it that way .
so in order for each other to understand each other , i & apos ; d like to show you a very basic , very simple magic .
and i & apos ; m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has been going on since the 1950s in each case for children .
i myself learned it from < unk > < unk > in the 1970s of < unk > in the 1970s .
i & apos ; m going to go into it and then explain it .
and then i & apos ; ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you & apos ; re able to figure out my hand that you can do .
i & apos ; m just going to keep the knife in my hand .
i & apos ; m going to get my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or comes out of him , i & apos ; m just going to turn my wrist right there .
in this way , you can see that nothing is moving at all time , but as long as i come over here , nothing can go to my sleeve or come out .
and the objective of that is really simple .
i & apos ; m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything & apos ; s fine , the knife will be held by my naked .
it actually sit so hard in its place that i can shake it , without its knife burning .
nothing moves into my sleeve or come out , no < unk > , and you can do everything .
< unk > !
now , that & apos ; s a trick that i often want to look at little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception if you look more closely , even when it & apos ; s a very simple trick .
probably a lot of you in this room know this trick .
here & apos ; s how it works .
i carry the knife in my hand .
i & apos ; m saying that i & apos ; m < unk > my wrist to make sure nothing disappears in my sleeve or will come out , and that & apos ; s a lie .
the reason why i & apos ; m < unk > my wrist is because there & apos ; s the actual secret of the illusion .
because the moment i put my hand in front of you so you can see it moving from the back here , my finger , just from where it was , where it was in a position that it & apos ; s sort of extended .
amazing trick ?
there & apos ; s somebody on the back who & apos ; s had no childhood .
so , here he is . right .
and as i look around , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why it is a deception that you don & apos ; t realize there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way that he processes information doesn & apos ; t count it doesn & apos ; t count , one , two , one , three , but it sees it as a group .
but that & apos ; s not what it & apos ; s about , and then i open my hand .
of course , it & apos ; s going to be there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick that & apos ; s there by my < unk > , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens is i & apos ; m < unk > , it & apos ; s when i & apos ; m < unk > through this movement that the finger is < unk > again .
i take this hand away . and here & apos ; s the knife .
you can run this trick with your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with golf ?
one year or so , i read a study that really blew my mind .
i & apos ; m not a doctor or a researcher , and so that & apos ; s an amazing thing for me .
what it turned out is that if you offer a against a form of white pill , in the form of a < unk > , it & apos ; s just a round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape where you give that placebo , for example , to change into a smaller pill , and you make these blue color and you have a letter to it , it & apos ; s actually more effective .
and this , although none of them ... they & apos ; re just < unk > .
but a white pill isn & apos ; t as good as a blue pill .
what ? that blew my mind .
but it turned out that it & apos ; s not all that much .
if you take ice , they & apos ; re even more effective than any form .
a colored capsule that & apos ; s at the end of yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
let & apos ; s play a role .
a pill a single day is not as good as three pills a day -- i can & apos ; t remember exactly the exact statistics . i & apos ; m so sorry .
but here & apos ; s the thing to do ...
... that the role of play is play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate < unk > , you need to grab a needle .
right ? an syringe with a < unk > -- a few < unk > of a < unk > substance that you throw in to a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your mind ; that & apos ; s a lot stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i & apos ; m going to show you another time when we have a < unk > .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn & apos ; t look as good as the blue pill that doesn & apos ; t work as well as a capsule does , which doesn & apos ; t seem as good as the needle .
and nothing of that really has some stuff in mind , and it & apos ; s just our faith in terms of making a stronger effect on us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i & apos ; m going to take something that is obvious , and i & apos ; m going to make it look real .
well , we know from the study that you have to reach for the needle if it & apos ; s about to leave .
this is an < unk > < unk > . it & apos ; s very , very < unk > . and i & apos ; m going to take you a little bit further .
this is really my meat . it & apos ; s not < unk > special meat that & apos ; s meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special thing of hollywood .
i & apos ; m now going to stick that needle inside my skin and push it through it till it comes back on the other side .
so if you & apos ; re < unk > -- if you fall asleep -- i put this out to a couple of friends last night in hotel room , and some people i don & apos ; t know , and this is a woman that & apos ; s nearly taken .
so i propose , if you & apos ; re going to get evil quickly , go for the next 30 seconds , or , guess what , i & apos ; m going to do the first cut here in the back .
you can see it in a second , but you can also see if you want to .
so , it goes like this , right here where my meat starts at the bottom of my arm , i & apos ; m just going to make a little < unk > .
i & apos ; m really sorry . do they do it crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side , it < unk > like this .
now we & apos ; re actually in the same context that we had when we got here .
roughly .
but now you can & apos ; t count my finger , right ?
so , i & apos ; ll show you . that & apos ; s one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , & quot ; ok , it & apos ; s not so stupid and < unk > itself to have a conversation with us for a few minutes . & quot ;
well , then i & apos ; ll show you .
so what & apos ; s the situation looking like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , & quot ; okay . i didn & apos ; t really see that . & quot ;
people in the < unk > are coming in now .
so let me show you a little near this .
that & apos ; s really my skin . that & apos ; s not a special number of hollywood .
that & apos ; s my meat , and i get < unk > of that .
so sorry . if you & apos ; re miserable , take a look away , don & apos ; t look .
people on the back , or those who will see it later , say , & quot ; well , that looks pretty impressive , but if it really was real , he & apos ; s -- you & apos ; ll see here , it & apos ; s a hole and if it really is . & quot ;
ok , let me just give you some blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
normally i would take the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there & apos ; s no lesions .
but i think , in this frame here and with the intention of making deception something real , i & apos ; m just going to just put the needle in there and get on the stage .
we & apos ; re going to meet some more times in the next couple of days .
i hope you & apos ; ll look forward . thank you very much .
everybody & apos ; s talking about happiness these days .
i & apos ; ve made some people count the number of books that were published with happiness in the title of the last five years , and they gave it up after about 40 , and there & apos ; s been much more .
there & apos ; s an enormous wave of interest to happiness under researchers .
there & apos ; s a lot of < unk > there .
everyone & apos ; d like to make people happier .
but despite all of these functions at work , there are several cognitive systems that make it almost impossible to think very clearly about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to fall by these cognitive thinking .
this is true of their own happiness , and it & apos ; s true to scientists who are thinking about happiness , because it turns out that we are exactly like everyone else .
the first of those fall is to admit complexity , complexity .
it turns out that the word is simply no longer useful word , because we & apos ; re applying it to lots of different things .
i think there & apos ; s a certain meaning that we need to limited it , but in general , something we need to give up , and we & apos ; re going to need to adopt the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a combination of experience and memory : basically , it & apos ; s between happy in his life and happy to be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they & apos ; re both very different from happiness .
and the third is < unk > , and that is the unhappy fact that we can & apos ; t think about a fact that affects well-being without its importance .
i mean , that & apos ; s a real cognitive trap .
there & apos ; s just no way of getting it right .
now i & apos ; d like to start with an example of somebody who had a front row after one of my lectures , who said a story . & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; -- he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music . and it was music .
and then he added , really emotionally , and he ruined the entire experience .
but it didn & apos ; t .
what it < unk > was the memories of experiences .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of < unk > music .
they didn & apos ; t care because he was < unk > with memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had gotten to keep .
what this really tells us is that we could think of ourselves and other people , in the sense , in two kinds of self .
there & apos ; s a < unk > self that & apos ; s alive in the present , and the present & apos ; s able to see the past again , but it & apos ; s essentially just the present .
it is the < unk > self that < unk > the physician -- you know , if the doctor asks , & quot ; now , when i catch it up here ? & quot ;
and then there & apos ; s a < unk > self , and the < unk > self is the < unk > and the story of our life , and it & apos ; s this that the physician & apos ; s asking : & quot ; how did you feel over time ? & quot ;
or , & quot ; how about your journey ? & quot ; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the < unk > self and < unk > self , and they & apos ; re both too < unk > is part of the < unk > of happiness .
now , the < unk > self is a storyteller .
and it really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts right away .
not only do we tell stories when we & apos ; re talking to telling stories .
our memory is telling us stories , which means what we must keep in our < unk > is a story .
and let & apos ; s start off with an example .
there & apos ; s an old study .
these are actual patients who participate in a painful procedure .
i & apos ; m not going to go into detail . it & apos ; s not much more painful these days , but it was painful than this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report 60 seconds of their pain .
and there are two patients . these are their records .
and they & apos ; ll ask them , & quot ; who of them suffered more ? & quot ;
and it & apos ; s a very simple question .
the patient b clearly suffered more . the patient was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had a patient b , more .
but now there & apos ; s another question : & quot ; how much did these patients think they had suffering ? & quot ;
and here & apos ; s a surprise .
and the surprise of a patient having a much worse < unk > on the patient & apos ; s population as a patient .
the stories of < unk > have been different , and it & apos ; s a very important part of how it ends .
and none of these stories are very strange , or great -- but one of them is this clearly ...
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the worse is where pain was at the very end at the very end of its pain . it & apos ; s a terrible story .
how do we know this ?
because we asked these people , after their own talk , and also much later , & quot ; how bad was the whole thing ? & quot ;
and she was much worse for a than for b in the design world .
well , that & apos ; s a direct conflict between the < unk > self and the < unk > self .
from the point of view itself , b had clearly a worse time .
now , what you could do with a , and we actually did clinical trials , and it & apos ; s done , and it works , you could actually increase the patient & apos ; s < unk > from a patient a , by simply putting the tube in it very , very difficult .
that will lead to the patient being suffering , but a little less and much less .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you & apos ; re going to understand that the patient is less than a , and you & apos ; ve got a bad turn , and you & apos ; ve got your patient & apos ; s experience is much better , because you & apos ; ve got a better experience .
what is it about a story ?
and that & apos ; s true for the stories that memory provides us and it & apos ; s true for the stories that we invent .
it & apos ; s a story that < unk > < unk > , great moments and ends .
it & apos ; s very , very important , and in this case , < unk > are the end .
well , life itself is still alive .
it has moments of information , one by one .
and you ask , what happens to those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they & apos ; re forever lost .
i mean , most of our moments -- and i & apos ; ve got it -- you know it & apos ; s true for the psychological present time . what it means is you know that there & apos ; s about 600 million of them in one month ; there & apos ; s nothing left behind them .
most of you are completely ignored by the < unk > self .
and yet , somehow , you get the sense that counting count , that what happens during that moments of < unk > , is our life .
it & apos ; s the limited resource that we consume while we & apos ; re on this planet .
and how we would eat it seems to be important , but that & apos ; s not the story that < unk > itself to us .
so we have the < unk > self and < unk > self , and they & apos ; re really quite different .
however , the biggest difference between them is spent time .
from the point of view itself , if you have a vacation vacation vacation vacation vacation vacation , and the second week is exactly as good as the first , then the vacation line is twice as good as the vacation .
that & apos ; s not how it works at all for the self effect .
for the < unk > self , an < unk > vacation is barely better than the < unk > vacation , because there & apos ; s no new memories being added .
they didn & apos ; t change history .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that < unk > a different from a < unk > self , and time has very little influence on this story .
well , the result of doing more is to remember and tell stories .
it & apos ; s actually the kind of choice , because if you have a patient , say , we & apos ; ve got two different surgeons , and we decide what he & apos ; s supposed to choose , then the one who is going to choose the memory that & apos ; s less difficult and not .
the < unk > self doesn & apos ; t have a voice in that election .
in fact , we don & apos ; t choose between myself . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future we don & apos ; t normally think of our future experiences .
we think about our future as < unk > memories .
and in fact , you can think about this , you know , as a kind of a good < unk > to yourself , and you can think of the < unk > self as one that sort of needs the < unk > yourself through experiences that doesn & apos ; t need for it .
i have the impression that when we & apos ; re doing vacation , that & apos ; s very often the case , which means we & apos ; re going to move forward to < unk > services in the service itself .
and that & apos ; s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much of our memories do we mean ?
this is one of the explanations that & apos ; s given to the < unk > of the earth itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation vacation we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i & apos ; d ever had , and i think is quite often relative to how i often think about it .
and i probably have this < unk > journey , which i & apos ; m going to say , i & apos ; m going to spend about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , these are three weeks , and these are only one and a half hours .
that & apos ; s where there seems to be a cold .
now , i might be a little extreme , you know how little appetite i have on the < unk > of memory , but even if you make more of it , there & apos ; s an actual question . why do we give out memories so much weight in the weight that you & apos ; re making ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
so , imagine your next vacation system , you & apos ; ll know at the end of the line , you & apos ; ll have all your pictures , and you & apos ; ll get a < unk > drug , so you won & apos ; t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you & apos ; d choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two kinds of self and you have to think about how you & apos ; re going to get this conflict , and that & apos ; s really not obvious at all , because if you & apos ; re going to see , in the senses of time , if you & apos ; re going to see an answer , when you & apos ; re in the answer , a response .
why we choose the family business , which we choose is a problem that < unk > ourselves with a choice between the two types of self .
now , these two types of self , two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one ourselves .
so you can ask the question : how happy is that yourself ?
and then they would ask , how happy are the moments of how happy are the moments of balance themselves ?
and they & apos ; re all -- happiness to moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we & apos ; re now able to get a pretty good idea about happiness even over time .
if you ask about the happiness of the human being , it & apos ; s a whole other thing .
it & apos ; s not about how happy a person is .
it & apos ; s about how happy or pleased the person is when they think about their lives .
very different term .
everyone who is not different from studying happiness , and i & apos ; m a lot to a lot of researchers about well-being that have looked at the exploration of happiness for a long time .
the distinction between happiness of < unk > itself and happiness in its last few years has been recognized , and now it & apos ; s about measuring the two < unk > .
the < unk > right now has got a global survey where over half a million people have been asked about what they were thinking about their lives and their experiences , and there were others in that direction .
so in the last few years , we & apos ; ve been starting to learn about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
and the primary lesson that i think we learned is that they & apos ; re really different .
you know how satisfied it is with your life , and it really doesn & apos ; t teach you much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , which is kind of related to < unk > .
what that means is , if you were to meet somebody and you were to tell them , oh , his father is an < unk > , how much would you know about his size ?
now , you & apos ; d know something about its size , but there & apos ; s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell you that somebody & apos ; s living a eight on a scale of 10 . they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his < unk > self .
so correlation is small .
we know a little bit about what the happiness feels like .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness essentially means to be satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that & apos ; s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two kinds of self , you & apos ; re going to end up doing very different things at the end .
that implication of what i & apos ; ve said here is that we really shouldn & apos ; t imagine happiness as a < unk > for well-being .
it & apos ; s a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason we can & apos ; t think of happiness is that we don & apos ; t pay attention to the same thing if we think about life and , if we really live .
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you & apos ; d think that people in california have to be happier when they , let & apos ; s say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in the climate .
now , it turns out that climate is not very important for the itself , and it & apos ; s not even very important for the < unk > self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the < unk > itself is responsible , you can end up -- some people at the end of california .
and it & apos ; s sort of interesting to pursue what happens to people who go to california in the hope of getting happier .
now , your < unk > self isn & apos ; t going to be happier .
we know this .
but one thing that & apos ; s going to happen is you think you & apos ; re happier , because if you think about it , you & apos ; re going to remember how awful the weather in ohio , and you & apos ; ll feel you & apos ; ve made the right decision .
it & apos ; s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
well , when we first talked to the phone a couple of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting conclusion that came out of this week .
is that something that you can share with us , because you & apos ; ve got a couple of minutes left ?
daniel < unk > : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we & apos ; ve found in the survey paper is a number that we really didn & apos ; t expect .
so we found this in terms of happiness in a < unk > way .
when we & apos ; re looking at how feelings vary by income .
and it turns out that under 60,000 dollars a year for americans , for americans , and that & apos ; s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it & apos ; s a large sample , under 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
60,000 : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they & apos ; re getting increasingly unhappy , the poorer they are .
and we & apos ; re getting a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i & apos ; ve rarely seen so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn & apos ; t hit you , but that lack of money should be saved , and we can measure that misery very , very clear .
in the spirit of others , of < unk > himself , you get a different story .
the more money you make , the more money you make .
that & apos ; s not true for emotions .
but danny in the entire american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people were taking this < unk > seriously , i mean , it seems to be putting everything on its head , everything we believe , like in terms of < unk > and so on .
are there a chance that politicians that the country would generally take a seriously as serious as seriously , and based on that , politics ?
< unk > : you know , i think there & apos ; s recognition for the role of politics in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it & apos ; s happening right now , and in other countries , it & apos ; s happening now .
people are struggling to recognize that they should think of happiness if they think about policy .
it & apos ; s going to be a little while , and people will discuss whether they want to study < unk > or whether they want to study < unk > , so we need to take this discussion pretty soon .
how lucky you can gain happiness very , very different depending on how you think , and if you think about the < unk > yourself , or whether you & apos ; re thinking about the < unk > self .
this will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , it & apos ; s time for you to measure the percent of the population .
this is going to be part , i think , in the next decade or two , of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me that this topic , or at least it should be the most interesting political debate to track about the next couple of years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny < unk > .
i & apos ; m a jane ways . i design video games .
i & apos ; ve been developing it for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it very easy to save the world in real life , as it & apos ; s saving in < unk > .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , spend more time playing games and games .
we & apos ; re now spending three billion hours a week at < unk > .
some of you may think , & quot ; this is a great deal of time for games . & quot ;
perhaps too much time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the future , according to the future , is just simply the opposite of it .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the world & apos ; s most likely problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that time dramatically .
i calculated that it took time in 21 billion hours a week to get it .
that may seem a little bit < unk > , so i & apos ; ll be able to act on this : if we face problems like hunger , poverty , global conflicts , global conflicts and obesity , i think we have to try to play games for at least 21 billion hours per week .
no , i & apos ; m really serious .
why ? this image pretty much describes why i believe that games are so vital for the survival of human species in the future . it & apos ; s serious .
this is a portrait of the photographers ? < unk > .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he built a camera before the gamers .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you & apos ; re not a player , maybe some of them are in that picture .
you & apos ; re probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but also < unk > concentration , all in a very difficult problem to solve .
if you & apos ; re also playing , you & apos ; ll see some of these , the ones that come straight up , and the mouth & apos ; s a sign of optimism . the technology has been quite surprising to you .
so this is a player standing on the edge of what & apos ; s called a & quot ; < unk > . & quot ;
oh , you know this . ok . so we have some players here .
a < unk > victory is a result so positive that they didn & apos ; t even know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you get there , you & apos ; re shocked that you & apos ; re actually capable of doing something like that , and that & apos ; s an < unk > victory .
these guys are on the verge of an < unk > victory .
and this is what we need to see on the face of < unk > all over the world , if we & apos ; re going to take on the image of the next century , the face of those who are < unk > on the face of any < unk > .
well , unfortunately , we tend to see this face in real life when we face difficult issues .
i call it the & quot ; in life i & apos ; m bad & quot ; < unk > . and actually it & apos ; s my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
this is me doing the & quot ; in life i & apos ; m really badly doing < unk > . & quot ;
this is a graffiti graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied , in my feet , why we were better than we were in real life .
there & apos ; s a problem many players have .
we think in reality , we & apos ; re not as good as we are in play .
and i don & apos ; t mean just less , but that & apos ; s part of it .
we & apos ; re getting more done in < unk > , i mean a good deal with motivation , a little bit more fun , inspired to connect to each other .
if we & apos ; re in a < unk > world , i think that a lot of us turn into our best version , anytime and now turned on , i think the problem is to try to solve it the same as , it takes to try again .
and in reality , when we fall out failure , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel < unk > . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , we may be depressed or < unk > .
we never have these feelings when we play games , in games , there & apos ; s just not .
and that & apos ; s what i wanted as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think that you could not just achieve everything ?
how can we transmit those feelings into play in reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to collaborative solving .
and i & apos ; ve noticed some things the epic < unk > in < unk > as possible .
so first of all , if you get to one of these < unk > , particularly in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are willing to give you a < unk > mission , and that & apos ; s instantly .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits your current level in the game , right ?
so this is what they do .
they never get a task they can & apos ; t solve .
but always at the edge of your skills , so you have to do it , but there & apos ; s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you & apos ; re not sitting around , and you & apos ; re walking around ; you & apos ; re always giving something critical to do .
and there & apos ; s type of time .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with you , to finish your epic mission .
we don & apos ; t have that in real life so easily , that feeling that when you & apos ; re in a long-term staff , people are ready .
also , there is this epic story , that inspiring story of why we & apos ; re there and what we & apos ; re dealing with .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you & apos ; ve & quot ; level high , & quot ; and & quot ; + 1 strength & quot ; or & quot ; < unk > intelligence . & quot ;
that constant feedback doesn & apos ; t happen in real life .
so if i come this stage , i don & apos ; t have to talk about this : < unk > and < unk > crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don & apos ; t get feedback in my real life .
so , the issue of < unk > like world of warcraft is that it & apos ; s very satisfying to be on the verge of an < unk > < unk > that we would rather spend our time in this period .
they & apos ; re just better than reality .
today , every world of < unk > have spent millions of years trying to solve the virtual problems of online video .
that & apos ; s not necessarily something bad .
it sounds bad .
but to see it in the context , < unk > million years ago , our first < unk > upright began to be upright .
so the first part of it , primate .
ok , so , if we talk about how much time we spend right now with play , it just makes sense , when you end time in terms of the human scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also appropriate . because it turns out that by using that time , we & apos ; re actually changing what we & apos ; re doing for as people .
we & apos ; re developing together too collaborative , < unk > creatures .
that & apos ; s the truth . i believe that .
so if you look at those interesting statistics , which was published recently by a researcher at carnegie mellon university , the average person of today in a country that has spends 10,000 hours with < unk > hours to the 21st century .
so , 10,000 hours is an interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , < unk > hours are the exact < unk > that they spend in school , from fifth grade five to degree of high school -- if you don & apos ; t , ever don & apos ; t forget .
so , here we have a complete < unk > on which young people learn exactly what it means to be a good player like anything else they & apos ; re learning at school .
and maybe some of you have read this new book by let them read & quot ; < unk > . & quot ;
so you know what the success of success , the theory of success is 10,000 hours .
it & apos ; s based on the great research of < unk > that if we spend 10,000 hours with the < unk > study of a 21st century to the 21st of < unk > , we & apos ; re going to spend too < unk > .
we & apos ; re going to do as well in doing whatever the most famous people in the world .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are < unk > .
so the big question is , & quot ; what exactly are players so good ? & quot ;
because if we could figure that out , we would have pretty much never have been there before .
so many people we currently have in the world that spend at least an hour a day at < unk > .
these are our < unk > , 500 million people , who are extraordinary things in & quot ; something . & quot ;
and in the next decade we have another billion players , which are extraordinary in whatever .
if you haven & apos ; t heard it yet .
the < unk > are developing < unk > that are saving energy and at < unk > , instead of doing so that players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil can play online .
you would expect an additional billion players in the next decade .
we have a total of 1.5 billion players .
so , i & apos ; ve come to think about what it is for us to make these games together .
here are the four things i found . first of all , < unk > .
ok , now , think of it as extremes of the extremes .
and < unk > is the urge to do something immediately , a challenge of master , and together with the belief that we have a positive hope on success .
players always believe that an < unk > victory is possible and that it & apos ; s always worth trying , and that & apos ; s the same .
players don & apos ; t sit around .
players are masters of spiders in spiders of social nets .
there & apos ; s a lot of interesting research that shows that people we like more after we played with them , even when they < unk > for us .
the reason it takes a lot of trust to play with somebody a game .
what we believe is that somebody will spend time with us that the rules will be told that we will be the same , and we will stay out until the end of that .
so the < unk > that & apos ; s growing from ties , trust and interconnected .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
productivity & apos ; s productivity . fantastic !
you know , there & apos ; s a reason why the average of < unk > 22 hours a week playing , sort of like an < unk > .
the reason is that when we play , we & apos ; re actually getting happier to work hard , rather than when we & apos ; re setting up or doing nothing .
we know we work as human beings optimal when we do hard , meaningful work .
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be a very small part of awe & apos ; s fundamental missions of it .
here & apos ; s a < unk > to put it in the right light , so you & apos ; re all familiar with wikipedia , the world & apos ; s greatest wiki .
the second even of warcraft in the world , with almost 80,000 oh , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they have collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet than there & apos ; s any other topic on any other doesn & apos ; t work in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four race that lead to one outcome , and players are the only , hopeful , hopeful individuals .
it & apos ; s people who believe that you can change the world as a single person .
and the only problem is they believe they can change virtual worlds , but not real .
that & apos ; s the problem i try to solve .
edward < unk > is a < unk > .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money at a profit .
and he says , & quot ; we & apos ; re going to be seen witness by no less than a < unk > in virtual worlds and < unk > . & quot ;
and this makes of an economist . so he makes sense .
and he says ...
not like me , i develop games , i & apos ; m kind of a < unk > .
so he actually says this makes sense , because players can achieve more in a more real life .
they can be connected in more powerful social < unk > than they are in real life , and they will get more feedback and reward in games than they are in real life .
so he says , it & apos ; s now perfectly logical sense that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real time .
i first agree , that & apos ; s logical .
but it & apos ; s definitely not a < unk > .
we have to start to turn the real world into a game .
my event comes from an event to < unk > 2,500 years .
there & apos ; s this ancient cube , from < unk > . you know ?
those fantastic < unk > < unk > had < unk > .
and these were , in fact , the first of people developed developed < unk > .
and if you & apos ; re familiar with the work of the ancient greek < unk > < unk > , you may be familiar with this story . the history of how and why games were invented .
according to < unk > , video games become more accurate , in the kingdom of < unk > during famine .
there was such great famine that the king of < unk > set up to be a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you had to get a extremes .
so they came , according to the < unk > , the < unk > and < unk > , a national strategy . on one day you would eat . the next day you & apos ; d play .
and they & apos ; d be so < unk > to be able to be so fascinating because games are so fascinating and with < unk > , < unk > productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you & apos ; d play . and the next day you & apos ; d be eating .
and according to < unk > , they survived that famine for 18 years by eating these famine on one day and playing the next one .
in the same way , i think we will be playing a game today .
we & apos ; re setting games on the road of the real world .
we & apos ; re putting games on everything that doesn & apos ; t work in the real world , especially in real life , and we & apos ; re taking out what we need .
but that doesn & apos ; t have to be the end .
and that & apos ; s exciting .
according to < unk > , after 18 years , famine hasn & apos ; t been better , so the king , a last < unk > < unk > .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a < unk > , and the ve been able to get a < unk > adventure .
they left < unk > , and they went out to find a new home , and they were leaving as many people back as they had to survive , and looked to the rest of the region they were in .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest < unk > show that these < unk > that later did the roman empire , have the same dna as the old ones have .
so scientists have recently come to the notion that < unk > & apos ; crazy story actually is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global social organization that took almost 20 years to explain what the famine might be .
so this crazy story could be true .
maybe you & apos ; ve actually saved their citizens by just < unk > in games for 18 years and then had these < unk > , and so much about playing with one another , they learned that it & apos ; s saved all of civilization .
so we can do that too .
we & apos ; ve been playing in 1994 .
this was the first wind map in real time in the world of < unk > . that was 16 years ago .
they were playing < unk > < unk > , we were playing warcraft for 16 years .
i & apos ; m saying we & apos ; re ready for our own < unk > game .
so they sent half their civilization to find a new world , so i & apos ; m going to take my 21 billion dollar bills a week .
we should make sure that half of us spend an hour a day playing with games until we solve the problems of real world .
i know you & apos ; re going to be asking , & quot ; how are we solving the physical world ? & quot ; and this question is exactly what i did my work in the last few years at the center for the future .
we & apos ; ve got this change in our office in some sort of around us to try to figure out what we & apos ; re supposed to get out of the future .
we don & apos ; t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then to empower people to get this idea into reality .
so we imagine epic won and give people the opportunity to reach them .
i & apos ; m going to show you a very quickly three games that i & apos ; ve designed to try to bring people of epic < unk > in their own future .
this is & quot ; world without oil . & quot ;
the game is by 2007 .
it & apos ; s a < unk > where you have to get over a security problem .
the < unk > is invented , but we & apos ; ve got enough < unk > , so it & apos ; s realistic and it & apos ; s going to be real life without oil , so if you go out to play , say , where do you get your food ?
we & apos ; ve been testing this game with surprising players in 2007 , and we & apos ; ve been covering them for over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an changing experience .
nobody wants to change their lives because it & apos ; s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you & apos ; re in a < unk > adventure and you say , & quot ; we & apos ; re about to get oil . & quot ;
this is an amazing adventure that you & apos ; re walking across .
find out how you were going to survive , most of our players have held habits in the game .
so we set out to play a bigger game bigger , more important , more important , than just < unk > .
we & apos ; ve developed the game & quot ; < unk > & quot ; at the center for the future .
so to start off as a planet & apos ; s computation is that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called & quot ; global community ability , & quot ; of course .
it & apos ; s a call to gamers , and we & apos ; ve built almost like a & quot ; < unk > & quot ; < unk > .
you know jerry < unk > , where there is & quot ; < unk > , & quot ; and you have the astronauts , the < unk > , and only together you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everyone is in the < unk > , and it & apos ; s our job for energy , food , health , health , security , safety and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks long .
they found 500 of these incredibly creative solutions that you can read if you google & quot ; < unk > . & quot ;
and the last game we bring out on march 3 , and it & apos ; s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you end up with the world bank , & quot ; social < unk > , & quot ; in 2010 .
we & apos ; re working with universities all over sub-saharan africa and we & apos ; re < unk > a social < unk > .
we have a comic book . we understand & quot ; level high , & quot ; for < unk > , < unk > , sustainability , vision , vision and life .
i & apos ; d like to invite you all to share this game with young people , around the world , especially in < unk > , who benefit from thinking together to save their own social enterprises , to save the world .
i & apos ; ll go back to the end .
i & apos ; d like to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don & apos ; t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that they agree with me that players are human resources that we can use in real life and that games have a great meaning to change .
we & apos ; ve made all these race , < unk > productivity , the ability to bring tight social networks , < unk > , and the urge for < unk > importance .
i really hope that we play together major games to survive on this planet a second century .
and i hope you & apos ; ll join me with playing and play .
if i come back to the next decade , i & apos ; m sure of two things : that we can create every future , and we can play all sorts of games .
so i say , & quot ; let & apos ; s start playing the game . & quot ;
thank you .
i & apos ; d like to share with you something that i noticed a few months ago in writing this article for wired magazine .
i kept writing my < unk > at the end of writing , but i was already done with the text of the text , and i noticed that i & apos ; ve never made before in my life , which is the word & quot ; disabled . & quot ;
i & apos ; m going to read you the magic bit .
& quot ; disabled , & quot ; < unk > : & quot ; < unk > , helpless , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > < unk > , ways of < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > .
bad news : healthy , strong , < unk > . & quot ;
i just read this list to a friend , and i just had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i just came up until & quot ; straight & quot ; and couldn & apos ; t read , and i had to get myself to the emotional and start from this < unk > .
of course , this was a < unk > old < unk > , and i was just thinking that issue must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early & apos ; 80s when i was just starting with elementary school , and that started my sense of self outside my family and form , also in terms of other kids and the world around me .
and god i didn & apos ; t use an < unk > at the time .
if i were to take this entry seriously , i was born into a world that somebody would perceive as a person whose life may run in a great deal of positive , but today i & apos ; m being born for the odds and adventure that i have experienced .
so immediately , in 2009 , i expected to < unk > and expect to find a < unk > contribution here .
here & apos ; s the < unk > version of this data set .
unfortunately , it & apos ; s not a lot better .
in particular , the last two words underneath & quot ; < unk > < unk > , & quot ; totally & quot ; healthy . & quot ;
but it & apos ; s not just about words .
it & apos ; s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it & apos ; s about the values that are in these words , and how we make these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many more < unk > societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that < unk > < unk > has a huge power in terms of what you & apos ; re talking about as well as < unk > .
so , what do we actually want to < unk > -- a disabled person or a powerful human being ?
in fact , if you & apos ; re a human being alone as a child , you & apos ; d be able to < unk > your ideas .
wouldn & apos ; t it be beautiful to open them up ?
one human who opened the doors to me was my pediatrician at < unk > institute in < unk > .
it & apos ; s dr. < unk > . it & apos ; s an < unk > whose name you may not be able to think properly . so he & apos ; s always been called dr. < unk > .
and dr. < unk > always wore a great colorful fly and was just done with children as well .
i found the time that i spent in that hospital was just great -- except for my life .
i had to < unk > all the way through this < unk > , < unk > < unk > -- in different colors -- you know this to my < unk > . and i < unk > those < unk > more than anything . i hated them . i hated them .
and i & apos ; m going to try to imagine even as an < unk > child with dr. < unk > and try to stop this exercise , < unk > without success .
and one day he was watching me in one of my practice -- this exercise was simply < unk > and < unk > -- and he said to me , & quot ; wow , surprising , you & apos ; re such a strong , and young girl , you & apos ; re going to pick one day .
and if you make it , i & apos ; ll give you a hundred bucks . & quot ;
this was , of course , a simple trick from dr. < unk > to make the kind of work i didn & apos ; t want to make , with the vision that five girls will be in the ward , but he actually took me to see my usual new eyes .
and i wonder today about how much his vision of me had shaped as a powerful young girl , and i have been able to imagine that , as a nature of nature , powerful , powerful and powerful girl .
that & apos ; s just one example of many , many adults , < unk > the imagination of a child .
but we & apos ; re starting to see examples of the < unk > , the way we & apos ; re not able to imagine our language doesn & apos ; t imagine anything that we & apos ; d all want : making it possible for each individual , to see itself as powerful people .
our language < unk > the societal changes that were triggered in many cases by a technological change .
from a medical standpoint , you can , of course , say that my legs , the < unk > for < unk > , < unk > from < unk > and artificial < unk > for bodies that allow people to actually use their own ways of < unk > and not to < unk > them .
so perhaps this technological change shows clearly because we & apos ; ve always had a different truth , which means every human being does something quite < unk > and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to our plus form is .
the human ability < unk > -- that & apos ; s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how to deal with < unk > , and i & apos ; m going to tell you something : this phrase that i don & apos ; t really love and wonder why i always feel that time .
this line of working with < unk > , from the idea that success or happiness depends on the challenge of creating a challenge without being shaped by this , as if my life is so successful , because i & apos ; m going to fall out of the possible life of one person , or another , or so , with a prosthetic prosthetic prosthetic prosthetic .
but the truth is that we & apos ; re changing . of course we & apos ; ve gone from the challenge , whether it & apos ; s physically , emotionally or even the other .
and i & apos ; m saying that & apos ; s good .
< unk > are not a barrier that we have to deal with to deal with our lives better .
commodity prices are just among our lives .
and i tend to see < unk > as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he & apos ; s very present , sometimes he & apos ; s hardly to see him , but he & apos ; s constantly with me .
and i don & apos ; t mean the impact , or the impact of a person & apos ; s life .
there are challenges in life and challenges , and they & apos ; re only real , and every person is different . but the question is not whether we get < unk > or < unk > , it & apos ; s clear .
so we & apos ; re not just responsible for making people who love to save before they & apos ; re doing it , but they & apos ; re also preparing to get along with it very well .
and we didn & apos ; t like our kids , if we just give them the feeling that they can & apos ; t adapt to it .
you have to make two things clear : for one thing the medical fact , to be a medical fact , and to others , we don & apos ; t think about whether i & apos ; m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and < unk > disability i had to take apart is that the world always says , well , she could describe me with that definitions .
in our desire to protect the people that are us at our heart , and to tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical experiences , or even to have a prediction on the quality of life that you expect , we don & apos ; t have to pay attention to people .
maybe the current concept , which is just paying attention to what & apos ; s broken , and how we fix it , to each one more disability than the one on its own .
if we don & apos ; t treat a human being , and we don & apos ; t see all its forces and possibilities , and we & apos ; re also creating the natural struggle that you may have , another disease .
we create a man that has worth our society .
so we have to look beyond the human possibilities and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , there & apos ; s between perception of our < unk > and our great < unk > , there & apos ; s a connection .
we should not try and avoid those < unk > times , or we should not try to avoid them , nor should we reverse them under the carpet , but it & apos ; s about finding opportunities in the world .
i & apos ; m also more likely to realize that we don & apos ; t necessarily have to < unk > , but that we & apos ; re open to hug this , to put it on a road map , and maybe even dance with it .
and perhaps we manage to view that < unk > is something that & apos ; s natural , < unk > and useful to see and feel so out of their presence .
this year we celebrate the 200 darwin & apos ; s birthday of charles darwin , and when he written 150 years ago about evolution , darwin had written in my eyes to something very true in human character .
so i would say this . i wouldn & apos ; t survive its way of life , and not the one of its kind , but the one that can best adapt to change .
it & apos ; s a conflicts of conflicts .
not just from darwin & apos ; s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and to survive , of course , is the struggle of human mind is to transform through conflicts .
so , again , change and adapt to the great human capacity .
and perhaps we don & apos ; t know what wood we & apos ; re going to be when we & apos ; re really tested .
perhaps that is exactly the sense of < unk > , a perception of potential , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can make some new importance , which goes beyond heavy times .
perhaps we can think of < unk > as change .
< unk > are facing a change that we haven & apos ; t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage that we have on our own is to believe that we should be normal .
let & apos ; s face it -- who & apos ; s normal ?
there & apos ; s no ordinary thing .
there & apos ; s the usual question . but not the normal . and would you really want to know the poor gray person if there really were it ?
i don & apos ; t think more likely .
it would be great if we could use this paradigm of < unk > against another possibility or < unk > , to actually explore it a little bit of dangerous , like this . so we can really release the forces of very many children , and really invite them to engage their communities and their business in special skills .
< unk > have found that we humans have always taken from the society of our own society : to be useful and to contribute .
there & apos ; s evidence that the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , have carried older people and people with severe physical injuries , and that may have happened because the life experience in the < unk > of these people is valuable to society .
they didn & apos ; t look at these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the town in which i grew up in a < unk > in the red & quot ; red & quot ; in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of an < unk > .
it was summer , and i had < unk > on it .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , & quot ; you know , if that & apos ; s not covered . & quot ;
and i turn around , and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i go , & quot ; excuse me , sir , know us ? i can & apos ; t remember that . & quot ;
and he said , & quot ; well , you may not remember me .
when i first saw her , i pulled her out of her mother & apos ; s belly . & quot ;
oh , so the one .
and , of course , it did , but then , click .
this was dr. < unk > , a man i knew just from my mother & apos ; s narratives that day , because , of course , i was very typical , to my birthday , two weeks late .
my mother & apos ; s medical doctor & apos ; s medical imaging was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the globe , who didn & apos ; t .
and because i was born with no < unk > , and my feet took off after you , and i only had a few toes on this and some toes on the other hand , he was the < unk > , this < unk > had to be the news .
he said to me , & quot ; i had to tell your parents that you & apos ; d never walk , and you & apos ; d never be as mobile as other kids or that you never could lead an independent life and ever since , you & apos ; ve just been < unk > me . & quot ;
and what really extraordinary was that he collected a whole childhood student of mine all the time , whether i & apos ; d won & # 91 ; in & # 93 ; a class class class class , whether i had won & # 91 ; with & # 91 ; the & # 93 ; the & # 91 ; unclear & # 91 ; unclear / & # 93 ; unclear & # 91 ; my & # 91 ; unclear & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; unclear & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; my & # 91 ; unclear & # 91 ; unclear & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; , & # 93 ; , & # 91 ; , & # 91 ; , & # / & # 93 ; , & # 91 ; , & # ; , & # 93 ; , & # 91 ; , & # / & # 91 ; , & # 91 ; unclear & # / & # 91 ; , & # 93 ; , & # / & # 93 ;
and he called this part of his leaving the x factor , the potential of the human mind .
you can & apos ; t just emphasize enough , how critical this factor can be for a person & apos ; s quality of life .
and dr. < unk > went on to tell him , he said , & quot ; i learned that if kids don & apos ; t always get something else , and even if you get some help , if you can get kids together too much , then kids can achieve very much . & quot ;
look , dr. < unk > changed his thinking .
he had the medical diagnosis , and how somebody talk about it , are two different things .
and i also had changed my thinking in the course of time , if they had asked me at age 15 , if i had gotten my legs against meat and bone , i would have gone to no second .
i really wanted to be normal at the time .
if you ask me this today , i & apos ; m not sure .
and this is what happened because i experienced something with my legs and i didn & apos ; t despite this experience .
and perhaps this change could happen , because i & apos ; ve encountered so many people who have opened the doors , instead of talking to people that wanted to < unk > me or wanted to < unk > an idea .
you see , it really only need one person who shows you how you can get your forces , and they & apos ; re through it .
if you allow someone to turn their own , inner forces -- the human mind is so < unk > -- if you do this , and for someone in a key moment , you open a door , then you & apos ; re very good for these people .
they teach them to open themselves to the doors .
the real meaning of the word & quot ; < unk > & quot ; in which word & quot ; < unk > . & quot ;
what it means is that there & apos ; s something in that is -- that & apos ; s the potential to take off .
again , what potential do we want to use now ?
in the & apos ; 60s , in britain , the & apos ; 60s , a case where < unk > were converted to < unk > .
they call this & quot ; < unk > < unk > , & quot ; in the united states we call it & quot ; < unk > . & quot ;
students are divided up into notes .
and a to a student get < unk > harder , they get the better teachers and so on .
they then gave over a time period with a & quot ; enough & quot ; the grade & quot ; very well , & quot ; they told you they were very smart , that they were very smart , and those three months later .
and of course , one of the things that < unk > would say was the other day , they were just sufficient .
and that & apos ; s the same thing it did after three months .
but only those that were still in school -- except for the students who had school .
what was critical to this study was that teachers weren & apos ; t < unk > .
teachers didn & apos ; t know that something changed .
they & apos ; ve just been told that be the < unk > and the students are identical with the grade , and they & apos ; re taught something to be treated them , and they & apos ; re treated .
the only disability is a broken mind , a mind that has been broken , has no more hope . there & apos ; s no more < unk > he & apos ; s missing our natural < unk > , < unk > < unk > , and our ability of imagination .
but if we do it to support the human mind , to continue to hope , to find yourself and other people around , to be curious and < unk > , then we really place our forces a positive way .
if a mind has this qualities , we can create a new reality and new < unk > .
i & apos ; d like to end with a poem written by a persian poet called < unk > in the 14th century , and that & apos ; s what my friend might get from . and this is called & quot ; the poem , not only god knows the name . & quot ;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that , through a few changes of your genes , one more memory might have a better memory -- more precise , faster .
or , you want to be more force ; you want more force ; you want more force .
would you like to become more attractive and more confident ?
how about living longer in good health ?
or maybe you & apos ; re one of them that has been moving forward to more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
which one would you like to have if you have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
some . probably about as many as creative people are out there .
that & apos ; s very good .
how many would choose to make a good memory ?
a few more .
what about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to think of that as a doctor .
if you can only have one , it would be a whole different world .
is this all < unk > ?
or maybe it & apos ; s possible ?
evolution has been a personal issue here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you a view of a doctor & apos ; s theme .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , < unk > < unk > , who also was an < unk > in the russian church once wrote a paper with the title of & quot ; nothing in biology doesn & apos ; t make sense or meaning in the design of evolution . & quot ;
now , if you & apos ; re one of those who don & apos ; t accept the proof of biological evolution , that would be a very good moment when your < unk > < unk > , take your personal < unk > -- i & apos ; m going to give you the permission -- and maybe make you < unk > your < unk > .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it true for others or is it happening to us ?
this is another glimpse of the tree of life .
in this image , i & apos ; ve been looking at a bush as a center of the < unk > in all directions , because if you look at the edge of the tree of life , all out of the outside world & apos ; s life , you & apos ; ve lived in the certain amount of those looking at the earth & apos ; s life , and complicated success .
so the human part of this experiment , far down , is of course what we & apos ; re most interested in .
we branch from a common ancestor to a modern chimps about six or eight million years ago .
in that period of time , there were maybe 20 or 25 different varieties of hominids .
some went and left .
we & apos ; ve been here for about < unk > years .
it seems like we & apos ; re quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually for the most part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are pretty similar .
do you realize that we can benefit from that , and we can < unk > the mechanisms of a shared bacteria to produce the protein of human genome , which is used to treat < unk > ?
this is not like < unk > ; this is the same protein that & apos ; s chemically < unk > that & apos ; s coming out of the back .
and what we & apos ; re talking about bacteria , is they realize that each one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it is in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , do you think about this when antonio i & apos ; m talking about in a sense of self , do you think about bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it & apos ; s warm , it & apos ; s dark , it & apos ; s < unk > , it & apos ; s very comfortable .
and you & apos ; re going to give them all the nutrients that they just might want to have no effort at all .
it & apos ; s a really easy way for bacteria , with white < unk > of unintended < unk > , < unk > response to the outcome .
but otherwise they are a wonderful place for these bacteria , just as they matter to their lives .
they help nutrients in the < unk > of < unk > nutrients , and they protect them against particular diseases .
but what & apos ; s going to happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of < unk > balance in a species ?
or are we wired to be something different -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
let & apos ; s take it back a step back into the big bang 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first stage of living , perhaps three to four billion years ago or four billion years ago , the first < unk > of the earth , as much as either of those organisms .
in this giant symphony of the universe , life on earth is just short for a second ; the animal kingdom , like a single drop , and human life , a small < unk > .
these were us .
and so this represents the < unk > of this talk , so i hope it felt i would have fallen to you guys .
now , when i was a college student at college , i had my first discussion .
i & apos ; ve been fascinated by mark and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the force of evolution , and i noticed something very basic : most of the existence of life in < unk > organisms , every cell shares every cell , and all the genetic information that the cell is carried on in both < unk > .
but at the time , as < unk > organisms , things started changing .
sexual reproduction runs into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome will < unk > the rest of the body .
in fact , one might say that the number of death in our body happens at the same time in evolution as reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a < unk > , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex , death for sex -- it seemed pretty sensible at the time , but with every year , it & apos ; s gone to my doubt .
i & apos ; ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who , in vegas , read his show in the & apos ; 90s .
and one night , there & apos ; s a pat at his < unk > .
so he opens the door .
he & apos ; s a < unk > < unk > < unk > .
she looks at him and she says , & quot ; i & apos ; m here for < unk > . & quot ;
& quot ; that & apos ; s wonderful , & quot ; says george , & quot ; i & apos ; m going to take the soup . & quot ;
i came to the conclusion that as a doctor , i was hoping to < unk > that was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily true , just a different way .
i tried to keep the body open .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild health after a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the < unk > of the genome to the next generation , adapt and survive generation after generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they & apos ; re and i & apos ; m developing like < unk > rockets to send out the genetic < unk > , to the next stage of orbit , to fall in the ocean .
and i think we & apos ; d all be the mood that got to be able to understand all of the way to understand , when he said , & quot ; i don & apos ; t want to make immortality through my work .
i want to get there by not getting through . & quot ;
evolution doesn & apos ; t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it doesn & apos ; t necessarily necessarily necessarily mean the most powerful , the fastest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution < unk > the creatures that adapt the best to their environment .
it & apos ; s the only test of survival and success alone .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that are < unk > , and by that they & apos ; re the hot steam , if fish were there , if it would make a vacuum , they & apos ; ve managed to make it a < unk > environment for themselves .
so , what that means when we look back at what & apos ; s happening in evolution , and how we think about people in evolution , and especially how we put < unk > into the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is that we & apos ; re not going to move forward .
we & apos ; ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons would have been that , first of all , we were able to get a lot of genes that would have been < unk > otherwise , and the population would have been removed .
and second , we as a species have so < unk > our environment that we & apos ; ve managed to adapt to it right now and we adapt to it .
and by the way , we & apos ; re < unk > and there & apos ; s so much that you can & apos ; t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to < unk > .
a second possibility is that it & apos ; s going to be a evolution of traditional kind , of course , service by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution slowly < unk > but they & apos ; re realized .
and so far the isolation goes when we & apos ; re living far away as a species far away , we & apos ; re going to be < unk > and the changes of the environment that evolution could produce in a natural way .
but there & apos ; s a third chance , a < unk > , fascinating and scary possibility .
i call it < unk > -- the new development that isn & apos ; t just natural , but run forward , and decided to make decisions about what we make .
well , how could this happen ?
how was it possible that we were doing this ?
let & apos ; s start off looking at the reality that people now , in some cultures , make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice in order to have more men than women .
it & apos ; s not necessarily good for society , but it is what the individual and the family decide .
so if it wasn & apos ; t just possible to choose the gender in your child , but also to give genetic diseases that would cure and prevent disease .
what if they could make the genetic changes to get diabetes or alzheimer & apos ; s disease or reduce the rate of risk or material ?
wouldn & apos ; t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
when we < unk > , these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost < unk > billion dollars .
next year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in < unk > to four months .
today , you can take a sequence of three billion base of the human genome , at a price from about 20,000 to the room of about a week or so .
it & apos ; s not going to take longer , until the reality is that there & apos ; s the 1,000 billion human genome , and it & apos ; s going to be accessible to everyone .
in front of a week , the national academy of engineering produced the < unk > prize for francis and < unk > < unk > , two scientists that have developed the natural process of encouraging the natural process of working faster and < unk > < unk > < unk > in a way to evolution .
a few years ago , the < unk > researcher < unk > < unk > for his research in which he took an adult , took a < unk > , and the < unk > of only four genes , the cell , the cell , to just take them together , is an area that made .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can make the human insulin in bacteria , make viruses that are not just protecting themselves , but can serve for other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it & apos ; s a experimental study in the gang with vaccine against vaccine that & apos ; s been grown into the cells of the cell .
can you imagine a good thing that comes out of tobacco ?
this is all the reality that & apos ; s happening today , and in the future , much more will be possible .
so just imagine two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your hand ?
what if you could change the sperm and < unk > , or the fresh < unk > egg , to give kids a better chance of giving a better chance to live -- to get rid of the diabetes , the cancer , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn & apos ; t want healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor that can enable the change to prevent disease , could also enable us to adopt < unk > , < unk > -- memory , better memory .
why not have the < unk > of a ken < unk > < unk > , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of energy ?
why not have the fast < unk > that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
they & apos ; re going to be < unk > .
and if we & apos ; re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we & apos ; re able to adopt the attributes that we want , we & apos ; re going to be transformed by < unk > evolution .
we & apos ; re going to have a process that may need probably 100,000 years , and we can < unk > it for thousands of years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that your grandchildren or your grandchildren , that you have to get around .
are we using these decisions to shape a society that is better , more successful than what & apos ; s more friendly ?
or are we going to selectively choose how we want some of us to have and not for others ?
will we create a society that is more robust and more robust , or more robust and more robust ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
and most deepest of all of us , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom of the wisdom that we need to make these decisions ?
for good , like evil , and maybe earlier than you might think , these decisions become us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you < unk > skills , or another one that helps you get back and go back .
so we at berkeley < unk > call this robot < unk > .
they & apos ; re not anything but something they put in the morning , and it gives them extra strength , and it & apos ; s going to increase their speed , and it & apos ; s going to help them keep their balance .
that & apos ; s indeed the true happy of human beings and machine .
but not only that -- putting it together and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it & apos ; s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we & apos ; re working on , we & apos ; re going to start talking about the american soldiers that & apos ; s on average , about 100 pounds on his back , and it & apos ; s the request for them to wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- < unk > , 30 percent -- < unk > < unk > .
so we thought we & apos ; d embrace this challenge and create a design solution that would help us deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to < unk > -- or human rights groups of universal design .
soldier : by the time i get over 200 pounds of terrain terrain , for all that time .
in his flexible design , it enables it to stand deep in a way that & apos ; s too physical and extremely sophisticated .
it feels like i want to go where i want to go and increase my < unk > and resilience .
we & apos ; re going to be here with our < unk > this device , this new field of energy in this year .
so it & apos ; s true .
let & apos ; s look at our loved ones , let & apos ; s say something i & apos ; m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people in the world who are sitting in a wheelchair .
that & apos ; s about one percent of all population .
and this is indeed a conservative estimate .
we & apos ; re very often talking about very young people in population who are in the < unk > of their < unk > life -- 20s , < unk > -- who & apos ; ve been hit by destiny and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it & apos ; s also about the aging population whose number of times it & apos ; s worse .
and so the only option -- when it comes to a < unk > or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , it & apos ; s been , by the way , since his age , i have to say , very successful .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
now , let me introduce you to < unk > , which is carried by amanda < unk > , which , 19 years ago , a < unk > suffered , which has result that it couldn & apos ; t run since 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda is wearing our project .
it has sensors .
and his fully < unk > sensors on the crutches , which is the signals that we have on our breath that & apos ; s attached to here on your back .
they & apos ; re also < unk > , and the < unk > is on their decided , just like on their < unk > , which they & apos ; re moving forward into this quite < unk > and very natural one .
i & apos ; ve been 24 years old and i & apos ; m in < unk > , as a < unk > < unk > as an < unk > < unk > me off .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and motion beneath my < unk > .
not too long after that , a physician in my < unk > and he said , & quot ; amanda , you & apos ; re never going to be able to go again . & quot ;
and that was 19 years ago .
he & apos ; s every green hope from my consciousness .
< unk > technology has taught me since then to learning to climb again and go up , and go even with my hands .
but nothing was invented to let me go back , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms for meet and to discuss with them .
it & apos ; s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the < unk > , but for everyone .
thank you .
home in new york city , i & apos ; m the head of a nonprofit organization at the < unk > organization called robin robin engineering .
if i don & apos ; t < unk > poverty , i & apos ; m an < unk > for a < unk > < unk > , i & apos ; m a fire < unk > fire .
now , in our town , in volunteers , we have to have a < unk > health worker , we have to be very early on in order to be able to < unk > < unk > .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers on the < unk > , so i had some pretty good chance to go in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the authorities , to figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the < unk > , he had just in a very serious entertainment with the ted community , which i & apos ; m sure had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and it stood in the < unk > islands and barefoot under a screen that & apos ; s out in the rain rain while your house was in flames .
the other volunteer volunteers who arrived in front of me -- let & apos ; s call him < unk > luther -- first of all , was asked to go into the house and save the dog of the < unk > .
the dog ! i was really < unk > .
there was any ll be any lawyer or < unk > who could now tell the rest of his life , the people that he went to a < unk > house to save a living creature , just because it was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the nearest one .
the < unk > < unk > towards me .
he said , & quot ; you have to walk into the house .
you have to go up to the fire at the fire , and you have to get some shoes . & quot ;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i & apos ; d hoped to do , but i went -- the < unk > up along the hallway , the real & quot ; real & quot ; by the time that happened with the long time , the < unk > were pretty < unk > into a pair .
i know what you & apos ; re thinking , but i & apos ; m not a hero .
i carried my prey back down , where i met my front door , and i met the loved ones .
we & apos ; re putting our estimate outside the < unk > , where , not surprisingly , got a lot more attention than mine .
a couple of weeks later , < unk > got a letter from the < unk > , which they & apos ; re going to be doing for a good use at saving their house .
first of all , kindness : somebody even had taken a pair of shoes .
both in my profession at robin protection as well as myself , and in my < unk > and volunteers , i witnessed by generosity and kindness at a large scale , but i also look at the service and < unk > of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they & apos ; re all important .
so if i look around this room and i look at people who either have achieved a < unk > success or come to their way , i want to offer this memory , don & apos ; t wait .
don & apos ; t just wait to make a difference in the life of another , until you get your first million .
if you have something to get , now there & apos ; s something to be done .
control them up in a neighborhood , < unk > park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will offer us a chance to save a life of a human , but every day , the possibility of us to change one .
so put them on ; save your shoes .
thank you .
bruno < unk > : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i & apos ; m just coming back from a community to know the secret of the human genome project .
a place where women are saying sex with sex & apos ; & apos ; hello , and the game determines the day -- fun of a serious matter .
and no , it & apos ; s not < unk > you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their general < unk > .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the congo world .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees , our next living relative relatives .
what that means is we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are well known for their < unk > .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of < unk > in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the prize , too .
whereas chimpanzees , fear of big , fear of < unk > guys , the < unk > of < unk > females .
they & apos ; ve come up with what & apos ; s really going on , because it & apos ; s a < unk > society that & apos ; s been noticed in the lethal force .
but unfortunately , bonobos have the least been familiar among the primate .
they live in the deep sea floor , and the observation is just hard to < unk > .
congo is a paradox -- an extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness self -- the location of a violent struggle that has been < unk > and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it & apos ; s no surprise that these destruction are also at the survival of the bonobos .
< unk > and the decline of < unk > can & apos ; t even hold a < unk > with the < unk > bonobos -- and even we & apos ; re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence , you can hear a < unk > laugh , that the trees go around .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as & quot ; love instead of war , & quot ; because they have < unk > , they have < unk > sex , with < unk > partners , and rules like that , and social conflicts .
i & apos ; m not saying this is the answer to all the humanitarian issues -- because the bonobos is made up of more than the < unk > < unk > .
bonobos -- like humans -- love playing their entire life .
game doesn & apos ; t just mean < unk > .
for us and it & apos ; s fundamental to the connection of relationships and the care of tolerance .
and with that , we learn trust and the rules of the game .
playing creativity and resilience , and it & apos ; s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos play , you can see the evolutionary origins of human origins , dance and rituals .
play is the game that < unk > us .
now , i don & apos ; t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images straight from the wild .
first , a < unk > on < unk > -- and i don & apos ; t think of < unk > .
so here we see a young female and male in a < unk > .
look what she is doing .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , & quot ; she & apos ; ll put it at eggs . & quot ;
i just think it doesn & apos ; t like him , don & apos ; t it .
yeah .
so < unk > are common , both bonobos and humans , too .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the < unk > that you bring new elements into the game -- like the testicles -- and also how the game is both trust and serious -- while making it & apos ; s fun .
but the game is a < unk > game .
play is a game called < unk > , and it can take a lot of forms that some of them are a little bit quiet , < unk > , curious -- maybe to try to find this again .
and i want to show you , this is < unk > , a young female , and she plays with water .
i think just like they might play it all alone , and we cut boundaries from our inner and outside worlds .
and it & apos ; s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected condition that we create is the real set of creativity .
this is just a small taste of the way that bonobos give us to our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to where we need to meet on rising challenges , by greater creativity and < unk > cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is skills .
in other words , play is our < unk > .
to succeed us over the world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best part out of our lives ?
play is not silly .
it & apos ; s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not teeth and claws alone .
just when it doesn & apos ; t seem to be appropriate , maybe play is the < unk > game .
and so therefore , my science teacher , let & apos ; s hug this gift of evolution and share together , while we play the creativity and its wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two subject in the middle of 1979 , at the same time , at the exact same moment , every < unk > baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each < unk > a baby .
now i don & apos ; t want you to take too much time to imagine because , if you imagine , all the time , you & apos ; re not going to listen to me .
just imagine for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in some case the < unk > is wearing a y < unk > , which hits on the x chromosome .
and in the other case , < unk > is a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome .
they & apos ; re < unk > . they & apos ; re both light years .
we & apos ; ll come back to these guys later .
in most of my activities , i & apos ; ve got two imagine .
under a hat , i & apos ; m involved in the history of the anatomy .
i & apos ; m a studying < unk > , and in this case , i study how humans do with anatomy -- that means human body , animal cells -- how they did < unk > with < unk > , with < unk > , think about bodies .
the other hat hat that i carried in for my work is the activist , as a < unk > -- or , as i sometimes say , as a rich lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have worked harder , ask the social norms .
so for example , i & apos ; ve been working with people who are identical , two people in a body .
i worked with people with < unk > -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often i & apos ; ve been working with < unk > people whose gender is in the -- so people who don & apos ; t have the average male or female < unk > .
and in general , we can use the word < unk > .
and < unk > comes into a lot of different forms .
i & apos ; m just going to give you a few examples of the types of < unk > that doesn & apos ; t correspond to the male or female standard .
in one case , you might have someone with an < unk > < unk > , and the < unk > gene of the y < unk > , the < unk > < unk > that we & apos ; re all < unk > at the stage .
and that & apos ; s why the < unk > start in the < unk > stage testosterone .
but because that individual is missing the receptors to identify the testosterone , the body doesn & apos ; t respond to the testosterone .
and it & apos ; s called < unk > .
so , high testosterone , but no response to that .
as a consequence , the body evolves more to the typical female expression .
when the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she & apos ; s a girl . she & apos ; s raised as a girl .
but it usually takes the puberty , when they & apos ; re growing , and their breasts grow , and they develop their period , but they don & apos ; t get their period until somebody comes to that there & apos ; s something different .
and what they & apos ; re doing is they & apos ; re making some tests , and they & apos ; re finding that instead of < unk > and other speakers , they & apos ; re actually carrying on top , and they & apos ; re wearing a y chromosome .
and it & apos ; s important to understand that you could think of this person as a male , but they & apos ; re not really .
women , like men , have something called < unk > in our bodies .
they are in the back part of our body .
and < unk > came together , which are these < unk > hormones .
most women , i think -- i & apos ; m a typical woman -- i don & apos ; t know my real < unk > , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me talk about < unk > .
we & apos ; re < unk > , and we & apos ; re talking to < unk > .
the consequence is that somebody like i actually have a brain that has put more < unk > than a woman who & apos ; s born with testicles , and he & apos ; s got a < unk > .
so gender is really complicated ; you & apos ; re not just standing in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be spread across the entire range .
here & apos ; s another example : a couple of years ago i got a man & apos ; s call by a guy who had been born to be a boy , he had a friend having sex with his friend , as a man , and he had just found out that he had a love , and a passed .
it had an extreme form of a its own body form .
he put himself on the womb , and in the womb , his < unk > were so active , that they created basically a male < unk > .
and as a consequence , his < unk > male , his brain was exposed to the < unk > male .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one did know .
and it wasn & apos ; t until he got 19 , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he did < unk > < unk > that the doctors found out he was inside female .
okay , just another quick example , for a version of < unk > .
some people with < unk > chromosomes , develop something called < unk > , which is < unk > < unk > .
we don & apos ; t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason kids use this kind of body -- be < unk > or < unk > twins , is it < unk > -- because surgeons are often adapted to the norm , isn & apos ; t because this is for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason that they & apos ; re often done different sorts of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that there & apos ; s a certain suffering with a certain identity < unk > .
so we have the concept that being a woman means to be a female identity ; to be a black person , is supposed to be an african anatomy , in terms of its own history .
so we have this < unk > idea .
and when we & apos ; re faced with a body that & apos ; s actually very different , that & apos ; s what we & apos ; re finding out about these < unk > .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about it .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of technology .
now you can imagine how astonishing it is when children are born , the two people in a body .
recently , where i & apos ; d been through a lot of times has been a lot of < unk > < unk > < unk > last year whose gender in the world & apos ; s world & apos ; s world & apos ; s environmental issues in berlin .
many journalists called me the question to the question , & quot ; what test are you going to take to see if < unk > < unk > female or male ? & quot ;
and i had to explain to the journalists that there wouldn & apos ; t be this test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn & apos ; t have a line between male and female , or between male and female and female and female and female < unk > ; we & apos ; re < unk > , of course , that & apos ; s the number of course .
so we & apos ; ve got a situation where the further our science , we need to recognize so much more so that these categories we & apos ; ve given to stable categories , which produced very simple < unk > to make permanent < unk > , much more often than we did .
and it & apos ; s not just related to gender .
it & apos ; s also in terms of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than what we & apos ; ve allowed to < unk > .
when we get to our japanese , we get into all sorts of more environmental areas .
we run , for example , for the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we & apos ; re going to be different from them just through few < unk > ?
as we push our science forward , we & apos ; re getting increasingly into a zone of the < unk > , where we have to recognize that the < unk > categories we had probably too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of human life .
one of the areas that we & apos ; re seeing that for the < unk > , in our modern culture , in the united states today , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
we have a hard conversation about which point a body to people , so that he & apos ; s right to have a different set of life than it is .
we have very difficult conversations today -- perhaps not as public as public in medicine -- on the question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never had a hard time fighting when someone was dead .
they & apos ; ve given someone & apos ; s only a feather underneath the nose , and when they moved , they haven & apos ; t actually buried it .
if she no longer moved , you have buried it .
but today we find ourselves in a situation where we humans want to take out < unk > organs and put it into other people .
and as a result , we find ourselves in the battle with the really tough question when someone is dead , and it gets us to a really difficult situation where we don & apos ; t have as simple categories as we used to .
now you would think that the entire collapse of categories somebody like me would make me happy .
i & apos ; m politically < unk > , i & apos ; m an unusual person with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it makes me nervous .
to understand that those categories are really much more insecure than we thought made me history .
and it makes me think back in terms of where democracy started from .
so to tell you about this data set , first of all , i have to suggest that i & apos ; m a big fan of the peace industry .
i know they were < unk > , i know they were < unk > , but they were great .
i find that they were so < unk > and strong , and so radical , what they were doing is i & apos ; m looking at the music for every few years , looking at the < unk > < unk > music , and it & apos ; s not to see it & apos ; s totally because of music .
it & apos ; s because of what & apos ; s happened with the < unk > .
now , the basic scientists have been , from my point of view , the original set of activists , and that & apos ; s why .
what she < unk > was a < unk > concept , and they replace it with another which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us was central .
how all of you remember , controlled our < unk > the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very basic idea of autonomy .
the interesting world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of < unk > .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who were making political power should have this political power , because of the < unk > < unk > of the grandfather to the son and so on .
and < unk > had this idea to go back and replace it with a new < unk > concept , and this concept that people were born with each other .
they < unk > the playing field and decided that < unk > , the common sense , not differences , and that was very radical .
well , they did that in part because they were part of an < unk > system in which two things were together .
democracy has grown , but at the same time the science grew .
if you look at the history of < unk > , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a more sustainable world .
they went from < unk > & apos ; s sort of , < unk > way of < unk > things , like an excellent concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very < unk > level of effect .
they moved to a more original concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
you & apos ; re not talking about god and nature of god .
they & apos ; re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , she gave us an idea that was very common .
and so they prepared for really wonderful , the future civil rights movement .
they didn & apos ; t think about it that way , but what they were doing for us was great .
so what happened years after that ?
for example , women use the < unk > < unk > , the concept of < unk > , which says that there & apos ; s an innovation that & apos ; s more important than the country , and said , & quot ; that we should have a learning curve and < unk > than why we don & apos ; t think so significant is significant . & quot ;
and women did that successfully .
the next was the successful movement where we saw people like < unk > < unk > , who < unk > about it , & quot ; am i not a woman ? & quot ;
we find men in the < unk > rows of < unk > saying , & quot ; i & apos ; m a man . & quot ;
again , humans , different skin color , who are < unk > against myself in a very different way of doing things , successful .
we see the same thing with the insurance industry .
of course the problem is that as we start looking at any common ground , we have to start thinking about why we maintain certain kinds of rules .
now , separation , i would love to sustain certain < unk > , < unk > , in our culture .
i don & apos ; t want to make a fish , for example , the same right thing as a human being .
i don & apos ; t want to say we need to move away from the anatomy .
i don & apos ; t want to say that < unk > are supposed to be right to give her informed sex or to get married .
so there are some energy sites that make sense to me , and that i think we should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it , and believe it made sense .
so let & apos ; s come back to these two creatures that were raised at the beginning of the talk .
we put two creatures in the middle of 1979 , exactly the same day .
imagine one of them , maria , three months of < unk > was born , so it was born in june 1 .
< unk > , on the other hand , is born to the < unk > , so he was born on march 1 .
just because of the fact that maria was born three months of < unk > , they raised all sorts of rights in front of only three months ago -- to have the right to have the right to drink the right to drink .
figure needs to wait for all this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the kind of birth of birth of his birth .
we & apos ; re finding other < unk > about what their rights are .
< unk > , who you think he & apos ; s a male -- although i didn & apos ; t tell you that he & apos ; s on < unk > -- to think that he & apos ; s a male , he can be moved towards what maria doesn & apos ; t have to worry about .
maria , in all states , can & apos ; t perceive the same law that i did in all that , and that & apos ; s the right to marry .
< unk > can marry a woman in any state , but maria can marry a woman just in a few cases today .
so we & apos ; ve got these permanent < unk > categories that are problematic and better .
and to me the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is making such progress in the anatomy that we have to make a point where we have to admit that a democracy which may be based on anatomy ?
i don & apos ; t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like science is on its own terms .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture needs a pragmatic attitude to be , & quot ; well , we have to pull a line somewhere , so we & apos ; re going to pull it anywhere . & quot ;
but a lot of people getting caught in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas at a point decided that to marry a man , that you don & apos ; t have a y chromosome , and to have a woman means you & apos ; ve got a chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it & apos ; s also very bizarre , because of the story i started to tell you about the < unk > .
if we look at one of the < unk > of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us a dream in his & quot ; i have a dream & quot ; to solve a kind of solution .
he says we should not judge people , & quot ; their skin color , but by the character of their character , & quot ; and go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , & quot ; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . & quot ;
but how do you do this in practice ?
how do you lot of people because of their < unk > ?
i & apos ; d also like to point out that i & apos ; m not sure we should give rights to people that way , because i have to say that i know a golden series , that probably make some of the people that i know rather than some people .
i & apos ; d like to argue that i probably know some bright < unk > , the < unk > < unk > , are more intelligent and more mature decisions about your sexual relationships than some < unk > relationships i know .
so how should we answer the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and some part of me asks myself , what if the content of a personality was something something that could be made in the future -- made by law ?
do we really want to go this way ?
i & apos ; m not sure where we & apos ; re going .
what i know is that it & apos ; s really important to think about the idea that the united states is really thinking about questions about democracy .
in our endeavor for democracy , we did our thing really well , and i think we & apos ; d do well in the future .
we don & apos ; t have the situation of how it is , for example , in iran & apos ; s case , where a man who turns to other men , gets < unk > with death , unless he & apos ; s willing to fall in what case he leaves .
states don & apos ; t exist in our form .
so i & apos ; m happy to say that we don & apos ; t have these states -- a surgeon i spoke to a few years ago that had a few identical twins that had < unk > identical to them , in part , to make them a name .
but when i first approached him , and he asked him why he made those interventions -- it was < unk > -- his response was that in his country , these kids were very bad , and that & apos ; s why he had to do it .
i responded to him , & quot ; now , have you taken political cause , rather than a surgery to separate you ? & quot ;
the united states offered tremendous ways of allowing people to be the ones that they & apos ; re not sure they & apos ; re going to try to change the state .
that & apos ; s why i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to note that i & apos ; ve talked a lot about fathers .
and i want to think about ways that democracy might look , or have looked like , if we had produced mothers more .
and i want to say something that & apos ; s a feminist is a little bit radical , and in fact , i think there may be a variety of insights that & apos ; s come from different kinds of anatomy , < unk > people to use when people work together .
i & apos ; ve been interested , for years because i & apos ; ve been interested in < unk > , i & apos ; ve been interested in research in the field of research .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we & apos ; ve come from studying studies is that women , on average -- not on average , but on average -- are tend to have complex social relationships and caring for people who are vulnerable to a lot of attention in the group .
and so therefore , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation before ourselves .
years ago , when i made a graduate , one of my graduate students asked me , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , it & apos ; s -- a really curious question .
he said , & quot ; tell me what is at feminism . & quot ;
and i thought , & quot ; well , that & apos ; s the stuff that i & apos ; ve ever heard .
feminism is all about stereotypes in the gender ; that & apos ; s why don & apos ; t happen to be a female .
but the more i started thinking about his question , the more i thought there might be some < unk > at feminism .
this is to say , there & apos ; s something on average , making female brains different from male brains , what & apos ; s going to make us old social relationships and < unk > < unk > to make the < unk > difference .
so where the < unk > were extremely < unk > about how individuals were protected from the state , it & apos ; s possible that if we put more mothers into this concept , we & apos ; re more likely to find a concept of not only how to protect each other , but how to care .
and perhaps it & apos ; s where we have to go in the future when we have democracy beyond anatomy -- to think of less about individual bodies in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
so that , if we & apos ; re trying to create a < unk > connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i & apos ; m < unk > , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in this , i & apos ; m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i & apos ; m obsessed with < unk > .
i love it to every chance to find a different < unk > , crazy to wear , and just recently to photograph and to blog .
but i don & apos ; t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of my second hand on < unk > and < unk > .
ooh , thank you .
< unk > lets me reduce the impact of my < unk > to the environment , and also to my wallet .
i & apos ; m making all kinds of great people , all the time i & apos ; m making for good purposes , i look pretty unique ; and i & apos ; m going to shopping at the very personal computer experience .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
when all the answers say yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase and tell you what i & apos ; ve been doing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , who gets someone with so many < unk > ?
so i & apos ; m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought along with me seven < unk > , and that & apos ; s about it .
< unk > have been doing everything i & apos ; ve done in my suitcase for a week .
i & apos ; ve discovered that i would take everything that i wanted to wear , i would find , once i & apos ; ve come back to palm springs .
and since you didn & apos ; t hear me from the woman who went out here at ted in their underwear -- that means i & apos ; ve found a few things .
and i & apos ; d like to show you my driving experience for that week .
sounds good ?
while i & apos ; m doing this , i & apos ; m going to tell you some of the lessons that i & apos ; m going to tell you whether or not i learned to wear it from those < unk > , nothing new .
so let & apos ; s start with sunday .
i call this the like tiger tigers .
you don & apos ; t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole piano , including the coat , took me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece , that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it & apos ; s almost no way of being bad < unk > if you & apos ; re wearing < unk > pants .
if you & apos ; re happy , you have other happy people on you .
tuesday : this is going to be completely back .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , and i & apos ; d be ready to go .
just be up to who you are .
if you & apos ; re surrounded by the right people , you & apos ; re not only going to understand it , you & apos ; re going to appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me that i looked like i & apos ; m making & apos ; dressed in the < unk > , or that i remind you to your leave .
i & apos ; d like to smile and say , & quot ; thank you .
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you look good in something good , it & apos ; s almost certain .
and if you think that you don & apos ; t look good in something , you probably have it right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me that day .
but it wasn & apos ; t until i turned 30 , i really realized what that means .
and i & apos ; ll wrap that up for you very quickly .
if you believe inside , you & apos ; re inside and you & apos ; re a wonderful person , there & apos ; s nothing you can wear .
so there & apos ; s no excuse for anyone in this audience here .
we should be able to < unk > everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden < unk > fit in everything .
and finally , saturday : to develop a unique , personal style , is a great way to tell about a world without saying a word .
i & apos ; ve been proven over and over and over again when people came to me this week simply because of what i was wearing , and i & apos ; ve had great conversations .
it & apos ; s obviously not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i & apos ; m going to donate all this again .
because the lesson i try to learn this week is that it & apos ; s okay to get here .
i don & apos ; t have to find these things emotionally < unk > , because right around the corner , there will always be another crazy , < unk > , < unk > in just waiting for me if i & apos ; ve loved a little love in the heart and it just < unk > .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all of you .
i have something here that i want to show you .
think of this as being a < unk > , as flying < unk > .
this is what we call our lab , < unk > design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this image -- i & apos ; m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this image in his room , but the reason i & apos ; m going to show you this is something very interesting happening in the formula in the last decade .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula a race , then they took their budget and put money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car was good enough and the driver were good enough , you won the race .
now , you need to win , if you want to win a race , actually something like this one -- something that < unk > in real time , some thousand sensors that get information out of the car , get this information on the system and then get it back and forth that car .
this is what you would call an < unk > , a < unk > .
and it & apos ; s basically a system made out of two parts -- an < unk > part and a < unk > .
what & apos ; s interesting about all these days is the cost of taking place in our life .
our cities were covered in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they become free computers in the free .
and as a computer in the free run , you begin to respond to another way , you & apos ; re taken , you & apos ; re perceived .
when we make cities , it & apos ; s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i just want to say that cities are only two percent of the world & apos ; s land on the earth & apos ; s land there , but 50 percent of the world & apos ; s population is there .
they are 75 percent of the world & apos ; s co2 emissions -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that & apos ; s one big thing .
in other words , in the cities , you & apos ; re going to see all this , and you & apos ; re moving into objects of life .
this is from an exhibition that was organized to moma later in the summer , organized by moma .
it & apos ; s called & quot ; talk to me . & quot ;
now , all of our objects , our environment , are beginning to speak back to us .
in a certain sense , it & apos ; s almost like every atom that & apos ; s out there becomes both a sensor and a sensor .
and that & apos ; s radically changing interaction that we & apos ; ve got people out there with our environment .
in a way , it & apos ; s almost like the old dream of mind ...
you know , as moses formed the moses , it means he took the hammer at the end and he threw it on moses -- in fact , you can still see a little < unk > site -- and he said , & quot ; < unk > , < unk > ? & quot ; why didn & apos ; t you talk ?
now , we are starting our environment for the very first time , to answer .
i & apos ; m just going to show you a few examples -- again , looking at the idea of our environment and what we & apos ; re doing .
so let & apos ; s start with this .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first things we do .
it was born four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we did was we actually used to use a new kind of network that was deployed all over the world -- that & apos ; s a < unk > -- and anonymous information and < unk > information from this network that & apos ; s been collected by the city to understand how it & apos ; s going .
summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was a italy when italy won the world peace prize .
some of you will remember it was as a italy against france , and then finally it was < unk > , the < unk > .
and anyway , italy won & apos ; t end up with this .
now look what happened on this day , except the activity of activity that happens in the network .
so here you see the city .
you & apos ; re going to see the < unk > in the middle , the < unk > < unk > .
and morning , in front of the game .
you see the timeline on top .
early afternoon , people here and there , those < unk > and they & apos ; re moving .
the game starts on -- silence .
france makes a door . italy .
< unk > , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second < unk > . end of the normal bits .
first extension , second one .
< unk > , in a moment of < unk > .
italy wins . yeah .
well , this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
you saw the big importance .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the prime minister and the prime minister at the same time .
and then it went down .
you can see the picture of space set up , where , since the roman age , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see that in the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel today , in a way that we couldn & apos ; t , a few years ago .
and very quickly , another example of feeling : here & apos ; s not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
now , these days we know all about where our things came from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is how they came together .
but we don & apos ; t really know just where things are going .
so we actually designed some little markers in this project to track waste while it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who were helping us , just a little over a year ago in seattle , to mark the things that they were < unk > -- different types of things that you can see -- things that you & apos ; d throw away .
we then have the little chips , the little brands , on the garbage structure , and we & apos ; re starting to track them .
here are the results we got now .
you & apos ; re from seattle ...
after one week .
what we found with this information is that there & apos ; s a lot of < unk > out there in the system .
we can make the same stuff in fact with less energy .
the data had not been available before .
but that & apos ; s what & apos ; s happening with a lot of more complex things and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we throw away doesn & apos ; t just disappear , it & apos ; s still on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we & apos ; re still going to throw out every day .
and if we show this to people , we can push a behavior change .
so that & apos ; s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , < unk > < unk > , could tell you much more about that , and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive , but i & apos ; d like to talk about the second part that we & apos ; re talking about , and that & apos ; s the < unk > .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in < unk > , spain .
it began with a question of < unk > that came to us and said that spain and < unk > have a nice tradition to use in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was , how could you bring technology together new technology to it ?
and one of the ideas that were collected with a < unk > < unk > was , imagine these tubes and valves , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > and < unk > and < unk > .
they & apos ; re going to get something like a < unk > out of water .
if these < unk > fall in , they can write on it , they can take pictures , images , text ads .
and they & apos ; re able to approach it up , and it & apos ; s going to open up , to let it go up and see how they can see in this image .
well , we presented the mayor of < unk > .
he did a great job with him .
and so we actually got the assignment to design a building on the board of the so that we can .
we called it the digital water < unk > .
all of the building was water .
there & apos ; s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it & apos ; s going to open and let it go in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it & apos ; s < unk > , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can actually make the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture , as in this case , you know , this days , if you put up the roof , you get images of people who were there and say , & quot ; you & apos ; re the building . & quot ;
no , they didn & apos ; t touch it , it & apos ; s just the way architecture disappears .
here & apos ; s how the building works .
you & apos ; ll see the person who & apos ; s going to wonder what & apos ; s going on inside .
and there you can see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
but it was really fun this night .
all the kids from < unk > came to the building because the way they played with the building was very different .
it & apos ; s no longer a building that would open to let them take a building , but a building that still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump right now without getting wet .
and that was , very exciting for us , because as architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , we & apos ; re always thinking about how people use the things we design .
but the reality is always < unk > .
and that & apos ; s the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with people .
so here & apos ; s a picture of the building with the physical < unk > , the < unk > that comes out of water and the projections on it .
and that & apos ; s what led us to thinking about the following project that i & apos ; m going to show you now .
imagine if these < unk > could really start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter to fly through the air , and each of these them with a little < unk > of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
so here & apos ; s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you & apos ; ve seen before , which is completely in sync with others .
you can have that cloud .
you can have some sort of flexible display or display , like this -- a < unk > formation in two dimensions .
but if you look at three dimensions , in three dimensions , where what & apos ; s changing , the light & apos ; s not the position of the air force .
they & apos ; re able to play with different kinds of things .
imagine on the screen could just appear in different directions , or sizes , in different ways .
but then this could be a 3d cloud of < unk > cloud that you can go through and through which you can move through , which you can look out of many , many directions .
here you see a real < unk > machine that < unk > around like a < unk > v before .
if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so , just like we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of them is being run .
it could have an individual impulse to have a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or so .
i & apos ; d like to show you something here .
we & apos ; ve been working with < unk > < unk > , one of the best < unk > in our time -- < unk > at the metropolitan theater in new york and < unk > -- we & apos ; ve taken the movement -- we & apos ; ve taken his movements in 3d < unk > into 3d for the < unk > .
there you can see < unk > dancing .
on the left , you see the < unk > , the various < unk > sensations .
it & apos ; s simultaneously an < unk > , and it & apos ; s a < unk > .
so they can felt the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then once we have all the < unk > , they can play with it and play with color gravity and < unk > .
we want to use that as a impulse to treat the water tank .
i & apos ; d like to show you the latest project that we & apos ; re working on .
it & apos ; s something we & apos ; re working on for the olympic games in london .
it & apos ; s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we bring back to people to do something and change the environment -- almost like what we call < unk > , as you move a < unk > cloud , but one cloud .
imagine that each of the little donation you can give a donation of a donation .
i think that the remarkable of what & apos ; s going on over the last few decades is that we have come from a physical to a digital world .
it has digitized everything , knowledge , and it makes it accessible by the internet .
today , for the first time -- and this campaign has shown this -- we can change from the digital world , from the digital world , from the < unk > forces of the universe to the physical world .
this can be in our case that we & apos ; re using it to design and make a symbol .
this is something that & apos ; s built in the city .
but tomorrow it can come in and make the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we & apos ; re actually < unk > people in that they & apos ; re doing things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of < unk > cloud , in the same way as a cloud , is really a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water as our cloud is a cloud of < unk > .
it & apos ; s a ridiculous thing in london , but it & apos ; s covered with < unk > .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually see it at the bottom , and share the most important moments for < unk > 2012 and < unk > , and use it as a form of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky , and something about the top of that you can go to , like london & apos ; s new < unk > .
they can go in .
and a kind of digital < unk > at night -- but as a < unk > , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i & apos ; m very interested in the relationship .
through my work , i & apos ; m trying to say that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is connected to one another .
the first time i ever had spent 10 years in antarctica , where i saw my first < unk > .
i was from awe .
my heart hit , i was < unk > , while i was trying to figure out what was i & apos ; d been looking at .
< unk > around me , almost 60 meters of the water , and i was just wonder that this was on a other scale , year after year .
< unk > are born as a calf , or by breaking it out of < unk > .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they & apos ; re interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some people call up , and they & apos ; re < unk > down to the street , while others aren & apos ; t < unk > , and they & apos ; re < unk > passion in a great time .
if you look at a iceberg , you have a little bit that they & apos ; re isolated , separate and alone , just like human beings often see us .
but the truth is far away .
as a iceberg , as i & apos ; m < unk > , i & apos ; m < unk > his atmosphere .
during the iceberg , < unk > drinking water that feeds a lot of life forms .
i & apos ; m going to go to my face of this < unk > as if i & apos ; m going to make portraits of my ancestors , that they exist in those individual moments , and never be so again .
it & apos ; s not a death if it melt ; it & apos ; s not an end , it & apos ; s a < unk > of your life cycle .
part of the ice in the ice that i & apos ; m < unk > is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and a part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i & apos ; d like to show you , show a iceberg that i & apos ; ve entered in greenland on .
very rarely , you & apos ; re actually becoming a giant iceberg .
so here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five meters long .
please pay attention to the form of the iceberg , and where it is on the front side .
you can see here , he & apos ; s starting to roll , and the boat is moving towards the other side , the man is there .
that & apos ; s the average size of an average size .
it reaches about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , you & apos ; ll see a iceberg at a different side of your personality .
thank you .
my life is really extremely blessed by working on some amazing projects .
but in the coolest , what i & apos ; ve ever been working on , it & apos ; s about this guy .
his name is < unk > .
< unk > was one of the leading form of the & apos ; 80s .
and then one day he came back from walking and he said , & quot ; < unk > , my legs . & quot ;
and that was the outbreak of outbreak .
< unk > is totally paralyzed today .
he can use his eyes just again .
i was facing him .
i have a company that does design and animation , so graffiti is a little bit more complex of what we admire in the art world and care about .
so we decided to help tony -- < unk > -- and his thing .
i met with his father and his brother , and i said , & quot ; we & apos ; re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? & quot ;
and his brother said , & quot ; i just want to speak with tony .
i just want to take it back to him , and i said , & quot ; wait a minute , isn & apos ; t that -- i & apos ; ve seen stephen hawking -- can & apos ; t all the paralyzed people through these devices ? & quot ;
and he said , & quot ; no , just when you & apos ; ve heard more well , and a remarkable insurance , you can actually do this .
normal people are not available for them . & quot ;
and i was like , & quot ; how are you communicating ? & quot ;
did anybody see the movie & apos ; s film and < unk > ?
that & apos ; s how they communicate -- your fingers run along like this .
i & apos ; m like , & quot ; very < unk > , how can that be ? & quot ;
so i came up with the need just for a check , and instead i turned out to be a check that i had not had the smallest idea of how i should throw it up .
so i < unk > to the place , and to his brother and his father -- to his words , & quot ; good , my suggestion & apos ; s like this : we & apos ; re going to get him a machine and we & apos ; re going to find a way to make his art again .
because it & apos ; s an causes someone who & apos ; s carrying all this still , that & apos ; s not able to communicate . & quot ;
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
i met these guys at < unk > , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put light on any surface on any surface and then put it on top of that < unk > that & apos ; s all the negative to put on .
so they & apos ; re pulling around , making < unk > like this .
they & apos ; re saying that all the things that are going to be shown up there will follow a life cycle .
it starts from the state department , and then the < unk > , after that , people actually make art .
but there was always a life cycle in your talk .
so i went home and i ate with my wife that night and told her about it all , and we thought , & quot ; well , let & apos ; s have this technology with which you can use your eyes to control things like this , we should find a laser .
that was the start of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot organization and a lot of things , we got some things done .
first , we & apos ; ve got the < unk > doors , and we & apos ; re actually given a machine that he can communicate with -- a stephen < unk > device .
that was amazing .
and he & apos ; s really extremely funny -- i call him < unk > , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you go , & quot ; i & apos ; m so < unk > , this guy is incredible . & quot ;
also , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- home to home .
my wife , my kids and i moved to garage , and that hackers and programmers and < unk > have taken over our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful that doing this and that we were kind of < unk > and all the images were < unk > onto the walls .
but for over two weeks we had programmed , we went to the < unk > village in < unk > , my kids were brought in , and my dog also , and we created this .
it & apos ; s called < unk > , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap < unk > that we & apos ; ve bought at the < unk > of < unk > , something < unk > and a few things from the hardware and from the < unk > .
we took a 3d visualization , we put it on a < unk > , and now we have a system that & apos ; s free -- you can make it yourself , we provide the code free , free software for free .
so we & apos ; ve created a device that & apos ; s completely free from limitations .
no insurance can go together .
no hospital .
now , everyone is able to actually communicate alone with their eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to < unk > room .
i love this picture because it & apos ; s somebody else & apos ; s room , and that & apos ; s his room .
now , this is all of these great unveiling before the great unveiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of < unk > , < unk > and < unk > design , began tony for the first time after seven years .
and that & apos ; s an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he sees his life support system .
we have his bed so that he can see outside .
we made a angle against a wall of the hospital & apos ; s hospital .
and he drew again for the first time in the < unk > of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
we also had to move forward into the space , so we felt like we were a part of the < unk > .
at the end of it , he would send us an email and say , & quot ; for the first time , i did a little drawing for seven years .
i feel like i & apos ; ve been put in the water and i & apos ; ve finally shut somebody down , and i & apos ; ve just finished my head so i can breathe . & quot ;
isn & apos ; t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our < unk > did .
that & apos ; s what keeps us going , and it keeps us going .
and we still need to make a lot better at this one .
it & apos ; s an amazing device , but it & apos ; s going to come in the same way .
and someone who understood that such a powerful potential deserves , deserves so much more .
so we & apos ; re trying to figure out how to do it better , faster and stronger power .
since that time , we & apos ; ve been getting all sorts of recognition all the time .
we & apos ; ve won some prices .
think it & apos ; s free ; none of us deserves it .
it & apos ; s got everything from our own pockets .
so the < unk > were , & quot ; oh , that & apos ; s fantastic . & quot ;
armstrong < unk > on us and then , in december , has honored us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really cool .
and the thing about it -- and that includes the whole circle of it -- that it & apos ; s this april , < unk > in downtown los angeles an exhibition called & quot ; the art of < unk > . & quot ;
and there , i think , is going to be quite the hardest representative of the u.s. -- < unk > , < unk > < unk > , < unk > -- all these guys are going to be there .
< unk > will be part of the show , which is pretty came out .
so basically , this is what you see if you see something that & apos ; s impossible , it & apos ; s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , that was < unk > -- everything was impossible eventually .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i & apos ; m not a programmer , and i & apos ; d never done anything to do with < unk > , but i just captured something and surrounded me with amazing people so that we could put something on my legs .
and that question should be , every single day , every single day that you make something that needs to be done , if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
thank you .
so i write for children , and i & apos ; m probably america & apos ; s most likely to be < unk > .
and i always tell people that i don & apos ; t want to come to like a scientist , therefore .
i can & apos ; t be a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever elected farmers .
today i & apos ; d like to tell you about circles and above .
well , one enlightenment is that you find something that you & apos ; ve found because you & apos ; ve dropped anywhere .
you & apos ; re talking about the block and you take it as revelation .
that & apos ; s a painting of a circle .
a friend of mine did it -- richard < unk > .
it & apos ; s the sort of complicated circle that i & apos ; d like to share with you today .
my circle started in the & apos ; 60s high school in < unk > , ohio , where i was the < unk > .
i was the one who was in the < unk > green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the toilet .
and they didn & apos ; t , don & apos ; t .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get out of town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me after san francisco -- i found a lover -- and then , back in the & apos ; 80s , i found it very important for a work at < unk > .
some three or four years ago , i got a phone call from this teacher , and this teacher , and woman said , & quot ; i have to see you .
i & apos ; m sad we & apos ; ve never learned as adults .
can you please come to ohio , and please come together with this guy that i know you & apos ; ve found it now .
and i should say that i & apos ; ve < unk > , and i want you to please meet yourself . & quot ;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we grew , and we knew they had to be in a services .
we found one for them , we took them down , and we took care of them , and we put them on their family eight , because it had to be necessary .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know as adults , who turned to know me , they came to a box full of a box , and they & apos ; ve been dumped in my hands .
what had happened was that the circle was closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation that i talked about .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and , you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i & apos ; m so happy that this has been mentioned today .
he needs the same -- he would need , love and pleasure -- and it & apos ; s to make those things .
thank you .
imagine a major explosion as you go up to 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine that < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > .
that sounds fear < unk > .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on < unk > .
i was the only one to talk to the < unk > .
so i looked at them in a second , and they said , & quot ; no problem , we probably caught some birds . & quot ;
the pilot had already < unk > , and we weren & apos ; t that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at once .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
that & apos ; s usually not route .
it turns out he & apos ; s turned on .
i want you to imagine an airplane that & apos ; s an airplane .
and then he said three words -- the most powerful words i & apos ; ve ever heard .
he says , & quot ; < unk > to the < unk > . & quot ;
i had no longer to talk to the ted conference .
i could see it in her eyes , there was horror , that life was ended .
so i want to share with you three things that i & apos ; ve learned that day about myself .
i learned that in a moment everything was different .
we have this < unk > , we have these things that we want in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to put in a hand and didn & apos ; t do all the fences i wanted to do , all the experiences i was doing .
while i was thinking about it , i got a saying , & quot ; i collect bad wine . & quot ;
because if wine & apos ; s there and the person is there , then i open him up .
i don & apos ; t want to move any more .
and this urgency , that goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned that day -- and this was when we launched the george washington bridge , kind of around < unk > -- because i thought , man , there & apos ; s one thing that really drives me away .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my own errors , i & apos ; d better be better , whatever i & apos ; m talking about .
but in my humanity , i also given my ego .
and i < unk > the time i wasted for < unk > things , with people who talk about things .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to my friends , to people .
and afterwards , when i thought about it , i decided to remove negative energy from my life .
it & apos ; s not perfect , but it & apos ; s much better .
i stopped two years with my wife , < unk > .
it feels great .
i no longer try to be right ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- while the inner clock was < unk > , & quot ; 15 , 14 , 13 ... & quot ;
you can see the water coming .
i said , & quot ; please send out the air . & quot ;
i don & apos ; t want this thing to happen in 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
while we were < unk > , i had this feeling of dying , man , is not terrifying .
it & apos ; s almost like we & apos ; ve been preparing for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn & apos ; t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness was really < unk > in one thought , which is that i would have one thing .
i just wish that i could grow my kids up .
and one month later , i came to a place of mine -- < unk > , not very much < unk > talent ...
well ... not yet .
and i say , & quot ; i & apos ; m making like a little kid . & quot ;
and in the world , everything made a sense to me .
i realized then by connecting the dots that life was just about to be a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my one goal in life to be a good parent .
i was asked to die in this day .
i got another gift , which was to see in the future and come back and live differently .
my call for those who fly today is : imagine that what happens on your flight -- please don & apos ; t -- but imagine it ; and how would you change ?
what would you do they < unk > that you & apos ; d think you & apos ; d be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships , and the negative energy in that ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents who can only be ?
thank you .
now , the idea behind the < unk > is quite straightforward .
we don & apos ; t want iran to build the bomb .
most important job there is for < unk > nuclear weapons , which is < unk > & apos ; s in < unk > .
the gray boxes that you see here are < unk > .
now , if we manage to < unk > systems , which control systems and valves , then we can actually address a lot of problems with the something on the order .
those gray boxes are not running with < unk > ; they are based on a completely different technology .
but if we can achieve that this is an effective < unk > on a laptop computer that & apos ; s used by a computer program to < unk > these gray box , then we & apos ; re in the store .
and that & apos ; s the planning to get behind .
so we & apos ; re going to start with a solar < unk > system .
the < unk > will be < unk > in the gray box , < unk > the us , and the iranian < unk > are < unk > -- mission at its mission .
it & apos ; s a easy , isn & apos ; t it ?
so i want to tell you a little bit about how we got this .
when we started < unk > our research six months ago , what was completely unknown was what the point and the purpose of this thing was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated in terms of the most complicated amount , the most popular part , of < unk > < unk > use .
and it seemed a little < unk > , with these gray boxes , to < unk > these < unk > .
and we started our attention , and we started a project that we started our environment with < unk > , and we looked at this built .
and then something odd happened .
< unk > < unk > like a < unk > that didn & apos ; t like our cheese -- < unk > on it , but didn & apos ; t want to eat it .
this made no sense in my view .
and after we & apos ; ve been experimenting with various kinds of cheese , it occurred to me that this is a < unk > attack .
completely looking at a particular goal .
the < unk > < unk > , active on the < unk > box , if a special configuration has been discovered , even if the special program that & apos ; s tried to cure on this goal .
and if it isn & apos ; t , then < unk > doesn & apos ; t .
so , this is really my interest and we started working on this , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don & apos ; t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , an < unk > american power station , or a power station in germany .
so we have to get better quickly figure out what the goal is .
so < unk > and < unk > , we found the < unk > code , and we found that it & apos ; s < unk > into two digital world -- a smaller one and a larger one .
and what we also noticed was that they were very professional , by people who had , obviously , all the information available to them .
they knew all the bits and the < unk > they had to attack .
probably they had the < unk > of the < unk > .
so they knew everything .
and if you & apos ; ve already heard that the < unk > of complex complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the < unk > are a science for yourself .
it & apos ; s much more difficult than anything we & apos ; ve ever seen before .
so here & apos ; s a clip from the code that i & apos ; m looking at .
we & apos ; re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks like ancient < unk > & apos ; s eye hospital .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart about this code .
so the first thing we did was we looked at < unk > because we knew what they were doing .
and then we looked for < unk > and < unk > and tried to connect that to the real world -- using potential goals in the real world .
so we needed to know theories about these targets that we could prove or wrong .
in order to make these theories , we call ourselves memory that it & apos ; s definitely < unk > < unk > , it & apos ; s a < unk > goal , and very likely it & apos ; s likely to be done in iran , because that & apos ; s where most infections have been put in iran .
now there aren & apos ; t many thousands of goals in this area .
it & apos ; s essentially a < unk > nuclear power plant and nuclear power plants .
so i said to my assistant , & quot ; get me a list of all the experts on < unk > and power coming out of our < unk > . & quot ;
and i called them , and i < unk > their knowledge to compare their expertise with what we found in the code and what we found in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it & apos ; s been possible for us to connect the little digital video game with the < unk > .
there & apos ; s a moving part of the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
and if you < unk > the speed of this thing , then in fact , you & apos ; re able to actually < unk > the < unk > and actually < unk > the centrifuge .
what we also found was that the goal of the attack was actually to allow it to happen slowly and change -- obviously in trying to give it a try so that you wouldn & apos ; t be able to get there fast .
the great digital < unk > -- we got a insight by looking really closely at data and < unk > .
so , for example , the number of < unk > isn & apos ; t very common in that code ; you can & apos ; t miss it .
i started doing some scientific literature about how these < unk > are built in < unk > , finding out that they are < unk > in what & apos ; s called < unk > , and each < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > .
so that made sense , it fit it together .
and it got even better .
these < unk > , these < unk > , are divided into iran , 15 levels .
and guess what were we found in the water business ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was really good together .
and this gave us great confidence for what we & apos ; re looking at here .
now , don & apos ; t get me wrong , it didn & apos ; t just happen .
these results were achieved through multiple weeks of hard work .
and often we just ran into a < unk > and we had to < unk > ourselves .
anyway , we found that both of the digital material was actually on one and the same goal was to be < unk > , but out of different directions .
the small power station is taking over a action engine , and therefore they slow down , and it & apos ; s slowed down big , and it & apos ; s < unk > with six < unk > of interaction design and happens to be < unk > .
so , in general , we & apos ; re very confident that we & apos ; ve actually defined what the goal is .
it & apos ; s < unk > . it & apos ; s just < unk > .
so we don & apos ; t have to worry about other goals being made by < unk > .
here & apos ; s something really cool stuff we & apos ; ve discovered -- really touched me from the amount of information .
there & apos ; s the gray box down there , and on top you can see the < unk > .
now , what this thing is that it < unk > the current values of sensors -- like , for example , by < unk > and < unk > -- and it provides < unk > code that & apos ; s still going on during the attack of the wrong piece of data .
and in fact , this false data is taken place called < unk > before .
so it & apos ; s exactly the same as in < unk > , where , in the united states , the < unk > fed a full set of < unk > < unk > .
that & apos ; s cool , isn & apos ; t it ?
and the idea here , obviously , is not just < unk > < unk > .
in fact , it & apos ; s much more dangerous and more violent .
the idea is to cheat a digital video game .
we need digital < unk > where a human being can & apos ; t respond fast enough to it .
so for example , in a power station , if the great air line is too fast , then you have to be < unk > inside milliseconds .
of course , this can & apos ; t be done by a human being .
so at this point , what we need is digital < unk > .
and if they are at risk , there are really bad things can happen .
this power station can explode .
and not the < unk > , nor the < unk > won & apos ; t notice .
this is scary .
but it goes further .
and the thing that i & apos ; m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is < unk > .
he doesn & apos ; t especially have anything to do with < unk > , or < unk > .
so he would , for example , work pretty well -- in a power station or in a power station .
it & apos ; s < unk > .
and you don & apos ; t have to -- when the < unk > -- you don & apos ; t have to pass on the < unk > stick , as we saw it in a < unk > way .
you could also use ordinary < unk > technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and finally , if you do that , you get some < unk > < unk > .
that & apos ; s the consequence that we & apos ; ve got to face .
so unfortunately , number of goals are not the middle east attacks .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the < unk > environments .
we have to face the consequences and we & apos ; re start to prepare .
thank you .
i & apos ; ve got a question .
ralph , it was reported a lot of it to say that people assume that < unk > is the behind it .
is that your mind ?
okay , you really want to know this ?
yeah . okay .
my view is that < unk > is involved , but the driving force isn & apos ; t israel .
so the driving force behind that is the < unk > power .
there & apos ; s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , to happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for letting us out as a < unk > . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years bringing myself in situations that are usually very difficult and at once dangerous .
i went to jail . very difficult .
i & apos ; ve been working in a field of science -- dangerous .
i filmed in < unk > -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but eating this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i & apos ; ve been exposed to the greatest part of my career to < unk > situations , and it & apos ; s all about trying to do social research project that you & apos ; re so compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way that makes you more accessible and more accessible to the audience .
so when i knew i was coming here to see the world of < unk > and < unk > , i knew i had to do something a little different .
some of you may have heard that i & apos ; ve done a display on ebay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent out some < unk > , some < unk > , and i gave people the chance to < unk > the < unk > off my tedtalk in 2011 .
in fact , some happy people and companies , < unk > and < unk > , you get the thousands of times -- because i & apos ; m sure chris & apos ; s never let me -- the < unk > that you didn & apos ; t get a lot of content in that moment .
so what you were given was this name : your name is , my tedtalk that you didn & apos ; t know what & apos ; s going to be the theme , and the content you & apos ; re ultimately going to be about the ears , especially if i asked your health information for your work was stupid .
but apart from that , it & apos ; s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people watch those tedtalks ?
a big deal .
this is actually just the < unk > .
so , despite that warning , i knew anyone would buy the rule of law .
now , if you had asked me this a year ago , i wouldn & apos ; t have been able to tell you that with confidence .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing .
as i said , i & apos ; ve gone through some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could get me wrong on anything that & apos ; s more complicated and as dangerous as this guy in a room .
you know , i had the idea of a film .
what i want to do is make a film about < unk > , marketing and advertising , and advertising , which is funded by < unk > < unk > , marketing and advertising .
and the film & quot ; the < unk > < unk > < unk > & quot ; is called & quot ; the < unk > . & quot ;
so what happens in & quot ; the < unk > < unk > < unk > & quot ; is that it & apos ; s all up until the beginning , from the very end to the end , with brands -- from the x , you see it & apos ; s the movie .
now , this brand , < unk > < unk > , the < unk > center ...
these guys are going to be connected to the film in time , forever .
and so the whole idea becomes this whole idea -- this is what ? in time , forever ?
i & apos ; m a < unk > person .
that was more to the emphasis .
it was , & quot ; to stay , forever . & quot ;
but we & apos ; re not only going to have the x as a < unk > , we & apos ; re going to make sure we & apos ; re going to sell every possible category of the film .
so we & apos ; re maybe selling a shoe and it & apos ; s going to be the greatest shoe you & apos ; ve ever wore ...
the greatest car you & apos ; ve ever driven , & quot ; the < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > & quot ; the greatest drink you & apos ; ve ever had , a attention from & quot ; the < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > . & quot ;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are a part of life , actually , bringing them to fund the film ?
and we & apos ; re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the entire film is transparency .
you & apos ; re going to see the whole thing in the film of < unk > .
so that & apos ; s the whole concept , the whole movie , from beginning to end .
and i & apos ; d be happy if < unk > was going to help to do this .
you know , it & apos ; s funny , because when i first heard it , it & apos ; s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don & apos ; t know how < unk > people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don & apos ; t want to use & quot ; perspective , & quot ; because that & apos ; s a negative set of energy -- but you know how that & apos ; s going to evolve ?
how much money will it take to realize this ?
1.5 million .
i think it & apos ; s hard to meet you , but i think it & apos ; s worth some really familiar brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , maybe we look like a < unk > .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is probably going to be most likely & quot ; no . & quot ;
but is it a difficult thing to do about the film or a difficult thing about me ?
it & apos ; s both means two .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
great .
we need to think about the brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people that they have to do with ...
there are some places we can turn to .
put out the camera .
i thought , & quot ; make the camera out , & quot ; meaning that we wanted to lead a < unk > .
it turns out it actually meant to be , & quot ; we don & apos ; t want to have anything to do with your movie . & quot ;
and just as disappeared as all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
and i didn & apos ; t want to have anything to do with that .
so i was amazed .
they wanted to be absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept that the idea of advertising was to present your product as many people as possible , letting so many people see it as possible .
especially in today & apos ; s world , at this intersection of new and old media and media media media -- it & apos ; s not the idea of being exciting in this new exciting new world that the masses of that news .
no , that & apos ; s what i thought .
but look what the problem was that my idea had a mistake that i made , and that was the following .
actually , no , that wasn & apos ; t the mistake at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but the thing that this picture is a problem .
you see , if you & apos ; re in transparency , that & apos ; s the right amount -- this is one of the first images that & apos ; s going to appear .
i really like your kind of sergey moving find . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- < unk > of deception and < unk > , just to discover and < unk > ; immediately by < unk > and access to information , especially in terms of < unk > -- the last line is the biggest problem .
you know , we & apos ; re currently hearing a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to here , it & apos ; s supposed to be implemented , something will change .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear , still < unk > .
it & apos ; s < unk > -- like these strange < unk > .
and she & apos ; s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole dish cool food waste .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , & quot ; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . & quot ;
see , when i was a kid and my father caught me up in lie -- and there he is , and he looks at me with this view -- he would say , & quot ; my son , there are three versions of history .
there & apos ; s your version , there & apos ; s my version , and there & apos ; s the real version . & quot ;
so you see , this film , we really wanted to tell the real version .
but there & apos ; s only one company , a agency , to help us -- and that & apos ; s because i & apos ; ve met john bond and richard < unk > -- i & apos ; ve found myself doing it alone , i & apos ; ve had to deal with the < unk > team directly with my team .
so what all of a sudden they started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is , it & apos ; s an energy problem .
i have friends who make big , giant < unk > , and i have friends who make little < unk > like me .
and my friends , the big , giant < unk > , say the reason why they & apos ; ve done so well , is because of the < unk > that they have .
and then my friends who make little < unk > , & quot ; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant < unk > ? & quot ;
and the film is called & quot ; the < unk > < unk > < unk > . & quot ;
so , how exactly will we ban in the film ?
always , if i go on the way , and every time i open the < unk > , you & apos ; ll see < unk > < unk > .
and every time i walk through somebody , i can say , & quot ; are you fresh to this interview ?
are you so far ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should put a little bit together in front of the interview . & quot ;
and we will provide one of those great < unk > .
either & quot ; < unk > fusion , & quot ; or & quot ; < unk > < unk > , & quot ; they will have a choice .
we & apos ; re going to be equipped for men as well as for women -- < unk > , < unk > , or a stick , whatever .
this is the < unk > area .
now i can answer all your questions and give you an < unk > .
we & apos ; re a smaller one .
so as you & apos ; ve talked about the smaller movies , we & apos ; re a brand < unk > .
so we don & apos ; t have a budget like other brands .
so making things like this -- you know , people remember ban -- that & apos ; s sort of why we are interested .
in terms of the words , what would you describe ?
ban is < unk > .
that & apos ; s a great question .
woman : technology .
technology is not the way you describe something that somebody & apos ; s supposed to get under the < unk > .
so we & apos ; re talking about bold , fresh .
i & apos ; m thinking , & quot ; fresh & quot ; is a great word that that the category actually makes something positive , as opposed to & quot ; smell and humidity . & quot ;
it & apos ; s holding you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , more fresh , three times more .
that & apos ; s kind of a < unk > effect .
and that & apos ; s a < unk > .
what about me ? what about the media business ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , who are like me , < unk > .
and they have to tell me something about my brand .
so how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don & apos ; t know .
i really like to love beautiful clothes .
you & apos ; re sorry for < unk > , besides at < unk > .
all right , so what & apos ; s your brand < unk > ?
unique .
i think the < unk > , the style i have , i think , is & quot ; < unk > glamour . & quot ;
i like many black colors , lots of < unk > and stuff like that .
but usually i have a < unk > , like digital , or a jewelry , and something like that .
if dan were a brand new one , he & apos ; d probably be a classic made < unk > .
man 2 : the brand i am is , i would say , < unk > fly .
that & apos ; s a part , a part of it , part of it , is < unk > < unk > -- i don & apos ; t know .
man 3 : i & apos ; m the < unk > .
i & apos ; m selling < unk > around the country , worldwide .
so i think that & apos ; s my brand name .
this is my brand in my small , < unk > industry .
there were four of us : my brand & apos ; s fedex because i was < unk > .
man 5 : brand < unk > < unk > < unk > .
so is this possible ?
being a lawyer : i & apos ; m a lawyer .
i & apos ; m tom .
now , we can & apos ; t all be the < unk > , but i often look at the intersection of < unk > glamour and < unk > fly .
and what it turned out to be that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who could really help me understand what & apos ; s called & quot ; < unk > . & quot ;
and so i found a company called < unk > in < unk > .
they & apos ; ve been growing companies like < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , to be able to study these < unk > .
if they could do it for those , they could help me .
and they brought their pictures , right ?
here i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how doing it with your mind and feelings about yourself .
these are the people that make my worldview .
tell me about this world .
< unk > : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like humans around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and everything .
these things came from , and they start from a place , and for me , they start with my family in west virginia .
so , that & apos ; s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is it about thoughts and feelings about them ?
it & apos ; s the way i wish to be .
i love things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about why & quot ; < unk > & quot ; -- what is it telling us ?
what & apos ; s the design brief ? what < unk > are you in right now ?
why is it important that < unk > ? what & apos ; s the red ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little more about them , they & apos ; re not .
what else did they take you through ?
... that doesn & apos ; t have to be fear . what kind of rollercoaster do you have ?
thank you ! no . thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don & apos ; t know what & apos ; s going to pull out of it .
and there were a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her < unk > two separate , but < unk > sides -- the morgan < unk > is a < unk > brand .
they & apos ; re very good in scale .
and i think there & apos ; s almost one contradiction with this .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength , not both .
many companies tend to -- and that & apos ; s the human nature -- things where they & apos ; re not sure , they & apos ; re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they & apos ; re < unk > these , and they & apos ; re actually turning them into something positive and positive .
what other brands do we need to act like ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , < unk > , wii , mini by mini < unk > and < unk > .
now , there are very < unk > brands and < unk > brands , these things that come and go , but a < unk > , < unk > brand is a pretty strong thing .
a brand < unk > , < unk > brand . what & apos ; s your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your < unk > , your < unk > , what would you be ?
are you a < unk > ? are you something that brings blood to blood ?
or are they more like an < unk > ?
are they something a little quiet , < unk > , conservative ?
< unk > are things that are playful , like < unk > < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > < unk > like < unk > < unk > and agile , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > .
or are they more like a < unk > ?
are they long-term over time and < unk > like < unk > ?
are they established , traditionally , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , < unk > , safe , safe , sacred , < unk > and < unk > like the dalai lama or < unk > ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and up , and they said no , & quot ; because they didn & apos ; t want to be part of the project .
they were going to have nothing to do with this film because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but what i found is 17 < unk > who were willing to < unk > to the control that people wanted to do business with people in a way that i & apos ; m doing , and that eventually led us to tell stories that we don & apos ; t normally have -- a stories would tell the story .
they tell us to tell the story of < unk > , the way we tell the story in this film , that today , you use < unk > to < unk > the < unk > of the brain , both to see and make films .
we went to very after < unk > , where there & apos ; s been a < unk > being banned .
there & apos ; s been no poster in the entire city for five years , no poster , no poster , no < unk > , nothing .
and we went to school in school where companies put their way into < unk > schools , all over america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most of the feedback , or where i & apos ; ve had the greatest success , those are the things that i & apos ; m talking about right on things .
and that & apos ; s what these brands have done .
because they < unk > the < unk > , they < unk > the agencies , and they said , well , maybe the agencies don & apos ; t really have their interest in mind .
i & apos ; m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i & apos ; m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people will think about creating what we & apos ; re doing in front of the world .
and how did that for you ? what & apos ; s successful ?
now , while the film was on the < unk > film festival , we can see that .
according to < unk > , the first time in january , and that & apos ; s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million < unk > of this film .
in fact that & apos ; s just a period of two and a half weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn & apos ; t yet been < unk > .
there isn & apos ; t even online now . there & apos ; s no < unk > .
he has not come out in other countries .
now , finally , the film has a very strong momentum .
and that & apos ; s not bad for a project where almost every < unk > that we talked to had failed to take their fingers out .
something i believe in is that if you make up your opportunity , taking risks , taking risks in these risks .
i think , if you keep people from them , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you & apos ; re prepared for the whole company to get a profit .
i feel like we need to be encouraging people to take risks .
we have to encourage people not to be afraid of possibilities that may happen .
finally , we should welcome the fear of welcome .
we should put the bear in the cage .
& quot ; welcome . welcome the risk . welcome the risk .
each of the < unk > people full , we & apos ; re very welcome to the risk at a time .
and finally , we should be welcome transparency .
now , more than ever before , a little bit of honesty is very far .
and this is said , honesty and transparency , my entire talk & quot ; welcome transparency , & quot ; they were introduced to you about my good friends at < unk > , the $ < unk > on ebay for your < unk > ebay .
big data is transformed into big opportunities for organizations around the world .
now , < unk > calls , & quot ; welcome transparency . & quot ;
thank you very much .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , this : now what happened to the dollar industry ?
that & apos ; s a great question .
i got a check in my bag on the < unk > of the < unk > , the < unk > islands -- a check in the high < unk > to fund my < unk > in the next year .
my name is < unk > .
i did what i did when i was 18 months ago at google , and i got < unk > , i had to do with museums and art . my art party , which is now , i had green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of < unk > negotiations and stories , i can tell you , 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i & apos ; m going to focus on the screening .
there & apos ; s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and access to you .
i grew up in india .
i was taught a great training -- i didn & apos ; t perform my job -- but i didn & apos ; t have access to many museums and this artwork .
and then when i went to see those museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i was trying to make this desire to do -- art accessible -- technology together .
we then put a team together , a great team , and we started with this .
i & apos ; m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since i started .
so you can & apos ; t go to < unk > .
you can look around all those museums here .
there is the < unk > , moma , the < unk > , the < unk > , van gogh .
i & apos ; m actually coming to one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of type in new york .
you just get on two ways -- very simple .
< unk > , and < unk > , it & apos ; s in the museum .
it doesn & apos ; t matter where they & apos ; re -- third , mexico , it doesn & apos ; t make any difference .
you & apos ; re walking around , and you & apos ; re taking yourself .
they want to be in the museum in general ?
open the map and jump with a click .
in that , they want to be on the end of the gangs .
just keep it . lots of fun .
look for it .
thank you , but the best is still coming .
now i & apos ; m in front of one of my favorite , < unk > from < unk > < unk > at the met .
i see this issue in front of me .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so this is one of the images .
these are all < unk > .
those of you who are really interested in art can click on here -- but i & apos ; m now taking that off .
this is one of the images we held with what we call the so-called < unk > .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion < unk > , i believe .
and a lot of people ask me , & quot ; what do you get for 10 billion people ? & quot ;
this is what i & apos ; m going to show you now .
you can do very easily and < unk > .
there & apos ; s something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is < unk > .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i noticed there was something going on .
and i thought , & quot ; hold that sounds interesting . & quot ;
i went close to ran , and i slowly noticed that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit , talking to some familiar with some familiar met , and i actually found out that it & apos ; s a game called < unk > , where it & apos ; s going to be a < unk > by a stick with a stick .
it seemed very popular .
i don & apos ; t know why they were doing it , but i learned about it .
to actually get closer , you can go down to the base of food .
just to give you a big picture , i look out of it so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best part is coming back in a second .
let & apos ; s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
another interesting thing about me , < unk > .
for example , the previous example was just to find detail .
but what if you want to see the < unk > ?
and what if you want to see van gogh created this ready ?
you & apos ; re < unk > in there . you can actually go inside .
i & apos ; m going to zoom into one of my favorite features of this image until i actually am on the site .
that & apos ; s < unk > , probably never seen that before .
now i & apos ; m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many further , but i don & apos ; t have time .
so that & apos ; s the really cool part , it & apos ; s called collections .
every one of you , every -- whether it & apos ; s rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn & apos ; t matter .
they can go and create their own museum -- from all these pictures they can put their own collection .
simply , they go in -- and i created this , it & apos ; s called the power of < unk > -- they can < unk > .
this is the < unk > , the < unk > .
you can put it all out with 100 cells , send with your friends , and start talking about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , finally , i think the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things here are not from google .
they don & apos ; t even come out of museums .
i don & apos ; t think i should say that .
they & apos ; re from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility to me .
i mean , i hope that we & apos ; ll be putting in this digital medium of art and < unk > them online .
the biggest question that i asked myself recently is , & quot ; did you do that to replicate the experience of a < unk > ? & quot ;
and the answer to that is no .
it & apos ; s to make use of the experience .
that & apos ; s what it & apos ; s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain , and your brain can be < unk > in two brains .
that & apos ; s the left half , the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the < unk > of any hemisphere , we could show their brain .
for example , this guy that is completely logical .
so this is somebody that & apos ; s completely intuitive .
now , where would you place your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided to have this extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high school board that & apos ; s simultaneously in both < unk > .
it & apos ; s not like they & apos ; re both exclusive or anything like that .
they can be logical and intuitive .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most other experimental colors , who need a good percentage to put together the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good share of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out there and play with it and then see how it responds , and then we start to develop our intuition .
they & apos ; re basically doing the same thing .
so one of the talks that they & apos ; ve developed over the years is that a thing at the same time can only be in a place .
i mean , it might sound strange to think that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they were born with this idea , they didn & apos ; t develop it .
and i remember playing a kid playing on a wooden < unk > .
it was a good game , and it wasn & apos ; t very good at it , and it always fell .
but i bet it means playing with the < unk > lesson a very precious lesson , which is that big things don & apos ; t just pass over and that they stay in a place .
and this is a great model of the world , so long , they & apos ; re not < unk > .
it would be a < unk > model for an < unk > because they don & apos ; t play < unk > , but rather these little weird particles .
and if you play with your particles , you can discover all sorts of weird things -- how they fly directly through walls , or you can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; it took quantum mechanics to describe these little , tiny particles .
but it wasn & apos ; t just to describe the everyday objects around us .
i didn & apos ; t enjoy my intuition , and i may just because i don & apos ; t have a lot of particles playing .
well , sometimes i do play with them , but not very often .
and i & apos ; ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody & apos ; s ever seen a particle .
but my < unk > page didn & apos ; t like it .
because if all the stuff is made of particles , and all those particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , isn & apos ; t it simply going to follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don & apos ; t see why that should be .
so i would feel better about the whole thing if somehow we could show that < unk > would follow the rules of quantum mechanics as well .
so a few years ago , i set about doing that right .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that & apos ; s been < unk > .
so what we & apos ; re looking at here is a tiny little computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
that & apos ; s the piece of metal i & apos ; m going to talk about in a moment .
and that & apos ; s a picture of the object .
here i & apos ; ll < unk > it a little . we & apos ; ll look right over here to the center .
and there & apos ; s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we look at is a little piece of metal , it & apos ; s like a what & apos ; s shaped , and it & apos ; s all over the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way , to making a computer chip .
i went with a clean space with new techniques , and < unk > for 100 hours on all the major devices .
now , for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to break this , like a < unk > pool , and to get that thing .
now , this thing has the ability to be in the < unk > < unk > , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
and you know , just how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i & apos ; m on the elevator , then i & apos ; m going to add all kinds of weird stuff , but then other people are getting up and i & apos ; m listening to all these things because i don & apos ; t want to do it , or frankly , it & apos ; s < unk > .
so quantum mechanics says that < unk > objects are also feeling like us .
it & apos ; s not just < unk > objects , but it & apos ; s also the light that seems to be on you and the wind that < unk > to you and the heat of space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal was < unk > , we had to get out the whole < unk > .
so that & apos ; s what we did .
we turned the lights off , put it in a vacuum , and we threw it all the air out , and we just threw it down till now , in the elevator , the piece of metal was free , to behave like it always wanted .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it was really moving strange .
instead of it just being quiet there , it & apos ; s kind of < unk > the way it was , like this -- like a < unk > and together , you know , < unk > < unk > .
in which we gave him a little push , we could get it to the same time and not to < unk > -- something that just allowed in quantum mechanics .
so , what i & apos ; m telling you is , what is really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and not to < unk > ?
let & apos ; s think of atoms .
so the first case : all the < unk > of atoms that are the piece of metal , quiet and then , over time , the same time , they & apos ; re moving on and off .
just to be < unk > , agree with < unk > .
the rest of the time , they & apos ; re < unk > .
that means every atom at the same time is at two different places , which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that & apos ; s really cool .
true .
this was worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , if you & apos ; re < unk > this , the < unk > between an individual atom and that piece of metal is kind of like the difference between the piece of metal and the difference .
so if one single atom at the same time can be in two different places , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why not they ?
i mean , that & apos ; s just what my logical page says .
so , imagine you & apos ; re at the same time in your places , what would that feel like ?
how would your consciousness actually handle that your body is inside the room ?
there & apos ; s another side to the story .
when we light it up , and the lights down , and the box went down , we saw the piece of metal always was there in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just < unk > objects that are embedded in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
well , that & apos ; s not exactly right .
there & apos ; s more to it , it & apos ; s even deeper than that .
it & apos ; s like , you know , these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that & apos ; s the < unk > and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be thinking about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they want to live and work , they have given you an opportunity to take on a full of different cities that are all in the competition around new experiences .
we & apos ; re at this point far from this .
there are billions of people in the developing world that doesn & apos ; t even have a single city that they & apos ; d welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they & apos ; re worth making as much more value as it costs them .
so we could make the world a very simple place called < unk > , perhaps hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd to you , if you & apos ; ve never thought about new cities .
now don & apos ; t just trade that of apartments against the cities that they & apos ; re built .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes did this already ; half doesn & apos ; t .
they could try to extend the capacity of they & apos ; re already using existing apartments .
but you know what you & apos ; d get into , in these homes and where they & apos ; d be able to get the law and if you & apos ; re going out of this thing and you & apos ; d be about building this stuff .
so it turns out to be very hard to get all these word .
but you could go to a whole new place , make an entirely new block of block that , hold the laws there , make it < unk > and not allow it to be held .
so what i & apos ; ve been suggesting is that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : < unk > cities .
i found out later that about the same time , < unk > and < unk > about the challenge of reform in < unk > .
they knew that , every year , there were approximately listening to their country to get to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure these people can stay in their country and keep it in the same way .
at this point , < unk > has said to < unk > , & quot ; what happens if we & apos ; re going to have a < unk > area of our country , what if we just put a message on the american part of the city and then the canadian part of the city . & quot ;
in the summer of 2009 , < unk > was suffering under a severe < unk > cell .
in the next generation elections , < unk > < unk > won < unk > in a context that has produced both < unk > and < unk > .
he asked to be a < unk > , to be a < unk > .
in the meantime , i prepared myself for a talk at tedglobal .
it & apos ; s through improvement , try and study with consumers , and i & apos ; ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of < unk > city to essentially reduce elements .
the first point , though , is the importance of laws , laws that determine that already you can not go through .
we pay attention to new technology , but for progress , we need technologies and laws . and it & apos ; s usually laws that make us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend in guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and he showed him back .
i call those two people my call .
and they said , & quot ; let & apos ; s present the energy level of our country . & quot ;
so we met in december < unk > in a hotels of miami .
i have been trying to see how valuable cities are to make how much more valuable they are than they are .
and i used this graph to show how valuable < unk > is in a place like new york , and remember that there & apos ; s a single area in some cases per square meter of thousands of dollars .
but it was a really abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , < unk > said , & quot ; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . & quot ;
so the tedtalk provided a very simple form that a < unk > city is a place where its < unk > country is , a < unk > < unk > , a law that defines the laws that are there and helps people decide to survive , or not , these rules .
that & apos ; s why i got asked by the president of < unk > to ask us to do this project , that it & apos ; s important and that & apos ; s the way we get our country forward .
i was asked to come to < unk > and go to the fourth , and fifth january , a lecture .
so i & apos ; ve given a bigger talk to a little bit , a graph like this one that tries to understand that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it & apos ; s a very large city .
this is a map of the city of systems , and the sketch was being built at the new airport , which was built in have been built in not in back .
at this airport , there & apos ; s 100 degrees of freedom to use .
so what i & apos ; ve been trying to do is convince you that if you want to build a new city , you & apos ; ve got to start with a place of at least 1,000 < unk > .
there & apos ; s over 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite to all the < unk > .
the audience & apos ; s faces were very serious and aware .
the director of congress came on the stage and said , & quot ; professor < unk > , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have it on my laptop here . & quot ;
i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i & apos ; ve come to the statement that a new city offers to people new ways .
there would be the possibility of living in a city that would be in < unk > , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new ways for leaders .
leaders of government leaders in < unk > would depend on the help of < unk > , which they could benefit from their < unk > that they put to the law for this charter and the next level that any trust is really true , that it & apos ; s actually < unk > .
and the realization from president < unk > was that the < unk > of the kind of < unk > that i & apos ; ve been given as a way to get the foreign investors to build this city , which could be equivalent to all sides of information in < unk > and foreign policies .
we went into an area .
this picture is from the place .
it & apos ; s worth 1,000 square miles .
and shortly after that , on the 19th of january , they voted for congress a change that & apos ; s different , to get a < unk > control system that & apos ; s good for certain kinds of brain disorders .
in a country that has just been a massive crisis , congress has just been elected for this < unk > voice into a voice .
all parties , all < unk > of society , supported this .
now , in order to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress .
february 17th , a second time of < unk > came to a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and february , i traveled to a place of about 30 < unk > to the two places in the world that were most interested in this thing , in the business of < unk > .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new city center , built in south korea , < unk > , as the city of < unk > .
and everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get these how .
the other place that was very interested in the benefit of singapore is singapore .
already two cities were built in china , and the third one is in preparation .
so if you & apos ; re practically thinking about it , it & apos ; s where we are today .
they & apos ; ve already got the < unk > , and they & apos ; re already thinking about this area for the second city .
it & apos ; s already been working on a system that < unk > allows for < unk > , and it & apos ; s also working on a external system .
a country already offered to give its supreme court to the court , as a court to the people & apos ; s calling to the < unk > calling of the system that is there .
also , < unk > and < unk > are very interested .
they even get funding with one .
one thing that you already know was there , there & apos ; s lots of < unk > there .
there are lots of kinds of businesses that would love to be in america , especially in a place where we live , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
across the globe , there are 700 million people who say they want to live in a new place .
a million people take every year of latin america , and pop it into the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to put their families together to < unk > work , sometimes they have to be single mothers who need to make enough money to eat and save clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it & apos ; s sometimes kids who try to find their parents , who they , in some cases , haven & apos ; t seen them for more than a decade .
so what & apos ; s it for an idea to think about this in < unk > is a whole new city ?
or even building these cities from these cities , or hundreds of them around the world ?
so what is it that an idea to insist on every family having a choice between other cities in competition that are new citizens ?
that & apos ; s an idea worth spreading .
my friends from < unk > asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions do you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions they make in a typical week ?
i & apos ; ve taken a poll recently with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that make a typical american , in one day , is 70 .
also recently , a study was launched with the ceos where they would watch the ceos for a week .
and these scientists just documented the different subjects that have been doing these ceo , and how much time they spent making decisions that relate to the issues .
and what they & apos ; ve found is that an average ceo is dealing with < unk > tasks in the week .
each of those themes , of course , was made up of many , many small decisions .
fifty percent of their decisions have been hit in nine minutes or less .
it only took about 12 percent of their choices to spend an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes of category to those who are category one hour ?
how good are you thinking , are you dealing with these decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the greatest < unk > in our modern time , the < unk > .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i & apos ; m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise your hand if i & apos ; m blind , i & apos ; m blind , i & apos ; ll just burn your hand if you & apos ; d like to burn some with you .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about < unk > ?
thank you .
when i was at stanford university , i went very , very < unk > , at least back then , he was actually exclusive .
it was a shop that was called the < unk > .
this business , it was almost like a < unk > .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and < unk > and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and vegetables , and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a period of time we actually drink .
i loved to go to that store , but at some point i wondered , well , how come you & apos ; re never going to make any difference ?
here & apos ; s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were embedded in boxes , that came from thousands of years of old < unk > .
so one day i decided to visit a leader , and i asked the director , & quot ; does this model , that you guys really offer all these options ? & quot ;
and he showed up on the < unk > of tourists that come every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose to do our experiment .
here & apos ; s her < unk > gang .
they had different sorts of brain damage .
we put a little < unk > directly on the side of the lake .
we & apos ; ve got six different tastes on < unk > or 24 different tastes of < unk > , and we & apos ; ve looked at two things : first , what is the case i & apos ; m going to try to stop more people ?
it & apos ; s been more people , if they were 24 , about 60 percent , than if they were six , about 40 percent .
and afterwards , we looked at what kind of people were buying a glass of < unk > .
now we & apos ; ve seen the opposite effect .
these people that were left when they were 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass .
of the people who stopped being six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of < unk > .
now , if you do the math , then the people bought a glass of water , who you had six choices as if you had 24 to choose .
well , buying a glass of < unk > isn & apos ; t probably good for us -- at least it & apos ; s good for our reasons -- but it turns out that the < unk > is also affecting us in very small ways as well .
we don & apos ; t choose to decide even though it comes to our own best interests .
so , the theme of the day : resource saving .
now , i & apos ; m going to describe a study that i took on with < unk > < unk > , < unk > < unk > , < unk > < unk > , where we made decisions about making the decisions of almost one million americans in the united plans .
and what we looked at was whether the number of < unk > that were allowed to be a < unk > plan that affected the probability of being saved , whether it & apos ; s going to be saved more tomorrow .
and what we found is that , in fact , there was a relationship .
in these plans , we had about < unk > plans that were giving people anything between two to 59 fund .
and what we found was that the more fund we had , in fact , the participation rate was lower .
now if you look at the extremes of the extremes , the plans that offered two fund , there was a < unk > in the & apos ; 70s -- still not quite as high as we want it .
in the plans that almost 60 fund now turned out to be about a year & apos ; s worth of education .
now it turns out that even if they were to participate , if there were more possibilities for choice , even then it & apos ; s a negative consequence .
so people that decided to be part of that , and the more opportunities they had , the more they had , the more things that are sales , the fund they choose to choose , the fund .
the more opportunities they have , the more they put together , the more they put their money in pure value .
none of these extreme decisions , matter to the decisions that people recommend would be important to us if their future well-being is important .
well , in the last 10 years , we & apos ; ve seen those very < unk > negative consequences that offer this to more and more choice .
they < unk > the choice -- they say , even when it comes to their own best interest .
they & apos ; re making worse decisions -- worse financial decisions and worse medical decisions .
they & apos ; re likely to choose to make things that will make themselves less happy even if they make it objective better .
so the main reason for this is that we may be able to enjoy this huge set of systems full of space , mustard , < unk > , < unk > , but in fact we can & apos ; t make it compare and then actually pick something from fantastic supply .
so what i & apos ; d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we & apos ; ve tested in different ways and different types of surgery -- that you can just use in your business .
well , first of all , narrow .
you heard it before , but it never has been true that less true than today .
people are always worried when i say , & quot ; limited . & quot ;
you always worry you & apos ; re losing < unk > .
but in truth , we & apos ; re seeing more and more and more that if you & apos ; re willing to < unk > and the < unk > opportunities are going to start , well , there & apos ; s an increase in sales of sales , there & apos ; s the cost , & amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ;
as a < unk > and gamble , the different kind of < unk > species of 26 to 15 , they experienced an increase in sales by 10 percent .
when the golden < unk > sold their 10 to the worst buy , they found that the revenues by part of stopped percent -- the outcome of both the increase in terms of sales and reducing cost of cost .
you know , the average < unk > today , it provides 45,000 products .
the typical walmart they have is 100,000 products today .
but the < unk > supermarket , which is the world & apos ; s most popular supermarket in the world today , and they only give you one type of system -- kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of < unk > , i think one of the best examples that have recently come out to the market , how best the choice is < unk > , when david < unk > is a big , it & apos ; s a harvard program .
now , every single harvard collaborator right now automatically takes on an < unk > part .
those of you who really want to meet a selection are offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , & quot ; i don & apos ; t know how to limited it .
they & apos ; re all important options . & quot ;
and the first thing i asked about the employees is , & quot ; tell me how the possibilities are different from one another .
and if your employees can & apos ; t < unk > you , they can & apos ; t . & quot ;
now , before we got lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he & apos ; d be willing to provide all the people in this audience to provide an < unk > vacation on the most beautiful street in the world .
here & apos ; s a description of the street .
and i would like to read it to you .
and now i & apos ; m going to give you a couple seconds to read it , and i & apos ; m going to ask you to clap if you & apos ; re ready to take gary & apos ; s .
okay . everyone who & apos ; s ready to take gary & apos ; s .
any of you ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
they knew it was a trick . right ?
now , who & apos ; s ready for that journey .
i think i probably heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that & apos ; s seen them objective , for the first time , more information than the second time , but i would say it & apos ; s a guess that they & apos ; d put it right in the second time .
because the paintings made it real for them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps me deal with the problem of < unk > , which is < unk > .
it & apos ; s about human beings to understand the difference between possibilities , understand what are the consequences associated with the individual possibilities , and that it & apos ; s going to feel the consequences of vivid and concrete .
why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average if they & apos ; re using a card or a credit card site than in cash ?
because it doesn & apos ; t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you make it work , something will feel more concrete , it & apos ; s a very good tool for saving people to save more .
so what we did in a study that i did with < unk > < unk > and < unk > < unk > , is we did a study with the people at < unk > -- employees that were all set to do for < unk > -- and all of them , and to all those cells .
and during this gathering , we have those meeting , just as they & apos ; ve always been , except we & apos ; ve added a little added water .
the small pieces that we added to was that we asked people to think of just the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were going to save money .
when we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was a increase in number of people willing to save , or a went up to four percent in the amount that they were willing to pay for the number .
third technology : < unk > .
we can deal with more categories than we can deal with more choices .
here for example is a study we did in a study cell .
it turns out it & apos ; s in the < unk > industry , and down in the northeast , the number of magazines from magazines has different kinds of magazines all the way to < unk > magazines .
but you know what ?
if i gave you 600 magazines , and you put them in 10 categories , or i give you 400 magazines and < unk > them in 20 categories , then you believe that i had given you more choice and a better choice than i would have given you by the age of 400 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different < unk > .
one is & quot ; jazz & quot ; and the other is called & quot ; < unk > . & quot ;
if you think the one on the left is < unk > , and the ad on the right is jazz , then you clap out into your hands .
okay , there & apos ; s a couple .
if you think that & apos ; s on the left jazz jazz , and that , on the right hand side , is < unk > , please clap .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they & apos ; re right .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is actually < unk > , but you know what ?
this is a profoundly < unk > photograph .
categories need to be able to tell to the < unk > thing , not to work with the selection .
and the problem you often see when you look at the long bullet points in these fund .
who are you actually trying to inform ?
my fourth technology : assumption for complexity .
it turns out that , in fact , we can deal with more information than we think we just need to simplify it .
we need to increase complexity .
i & apos ; ll show you an example of what i mean .
so let & apos ; s take a very , very complicated decision : buy the buy of a car .
here & apos ; s a german < unk > that gives them the opportunity to completely < unk > their car on their own .
they have to make advertising different decisions to shape their car completely .
now , these choices are different from the number of choices that they provide per choice .
< unk > , < unk > of the car -- i & apos ; ve got 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
so what i do now is i change the order of making decisions .
half the customers goes from the many possibilities , 56 < unk > to the small power , four gears .
the other half of the customers goes from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 , to many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
i think you & apos ; re interested .
if you & apos ; re constantly using the < unk > of the decision , it means you & apos ; re getting overwhelmed , i & apos ; m losing it .
what you find out is that the people who go from a lot to the small , always go out and choose the < unk > .
we lose them .
go from those little choice to the many , and then stay there .
it & apos ; s the same information . it & apos ; s the same amount of possibilities .
the only thing i & apos ; ve done is reverse engineer the order of this information .
when i start with the simple starting line , i study like myself .
even though the gears picked up , i don & apos ; t actually say anything about my preferences in the interior , it still drives me around .
it & apos ; s getting me excited about the big product that i & apos ; m < unk > , so i & apos ; m willing to be willing to take care of that .
let me wrap it up .
i & apos ; ve told you about four techniques that < unk > the issue of < unk > -- < unk > -- they & apos ; re going to get rid of the alternatives ; they & apos ; re doing it real ; -- we can put better with more categories , less complexity , less complexity .
each of those techniques i & apos ; m going to describe to you today is to help them manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you will provide .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you & apos ; re in choosing .
and the more we pick and choose , the better we & apos ; re going to be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i & apos ; m a kevin < unk > , < unk > at youtube . if i look at < unk > .
it & apos ; s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are turned off , and then why it & apos ; s even important .
we all want star -- & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; , guys , singers , father & # 91 ; -- when i was & # 93 ; young , seemed to be so hard .
but < unk > have allowed all of us or all of our creative activities to be < unk > in some part of the culture of the world .
any one of you could be about the internet till saturday morning .
but if you have youtube , there are over 48 hours of video every minute .
again , just a tiny percentage of it & apos ; s ever going to be seen , and it & apos ; s going to look at thousands of times and such a moment of cultural moment .
so how does it work ?
three things : < unk > , < unk > and unexpected .
well , then let & apos ; s go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
< unk > !
< unk > , < unk > !
last year , < unk > < unk > < unk > this video that he filmed in front of his house in the national park .
2010 , it was 23 million times in 2010 .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was popular for the first time in summer .
it really wasn & apos ; t trying to make a viral video .
it just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do that just in a way when you & apos ; re < unk > street , it & apos ; s time to be < unk > .
he uploaded a lot of < unk > .
and that video was actually sent to january .
what & apos ; s happened here ?
jimmy < unk > came .
jimmy < unk > < unk > study the tweet that ended the < unk > & apos ; s & quot ; < unk > & quot ;
because like jimmy < unk > , we & apos ; re putting in new and interesting things , and they show you a big audience .
it says & apos ; s < unk > < unk > . < unk > result on < unk > . < unk > & apos ; s < unk > < unk > to the < unk > , < unk > < unk > < unk > . we & apos ; re not talking about < unk > issues .
rebecca < unk > & apos ; s & quot ; < unk > & quot ; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it & apos ; s been shown almost 200 million times this year .
this is how the graphics looked .
just like the & quot ; double < unk > & quot ; it seems to be from nothing .
so what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , it was true .
if you want to know it , those other peaks are also < unk > .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , lots of blogs started writing about this , lots of blogs .
michael say nelson of the < unk > science theater was a first person to do a joke on twitter .
what & apos ; s important is that an individual or a group of < unk > put up a point in the audience , shared with a huge audience , and thereby < unk > the process .
then this community of people shared this great < unk > , and started talking with it and playing around with it .
now there are 10,000 < unk > of youtube & apos ; s & quot ; < unk > & quot ; on youtube .
already , in the first seven days , there was a < unk > for each individual < unk > .
unlike the < unk > entertainment conversation in the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to be part of this phenomenon -- either by making it spread or making something new .
& quot ; < unk > < unk > & quot ; is animation and music in < unk > .
it & apos ; s pretty simple .
this year it turned out to be almost 50 million times .
and if you think that & apos ; s crazy , you should know that there & apos ; s an < unk > that & apos ; s been looked at four million times as many of the time .
there & apos ; s even cats watching that video .
cats can look at cats who have a look at this video .
but what & apos ; s important is the creativity that & apos ; s going on inside of the food industry and the < unk > .
there & apos ; s been working .
somebody went through an ancient version of it .
and then it got international .
a total of all the < unk > from the soil that made it from a stupid joke to something we can all join .
now we don & apos ; t just find our pleasure on what we do .
who could have done all that ?
who could have predicted & quot ; double & quot ; or rebecca or & quot ; black or & quot ; < unk > & quot ; predict & quot ; predict & quot ; ? & quot ;
what kind of < unk > did you learn to write in which this sort of < unk > ?
in a world where every minute or two days & apos ; s video is uploaded to video , it can only really get unique and unexpected examples like the videos i & apos ; m talking about .
i & apos ; m going to admit i wasn & apos ; t terribly interested in when a friend told me i should look at this great video , about a guy that & apos ; s in new york against ticket .
i got a ticket ticket , because i didn & apos ; t drive on the < unk > , but often there & apos ; s disabilities that don & apos ; t allow you to drive a fair course .
because it was totally surprising , and they had been seen casey < unk > & apos ; s first idea , and his argument was five million times in the world .
this approach applies to everything that we do creative .
and all this leads to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
< unk > .
what does that mean ?
< unk > , creative , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that has access to each and in the audience .
and as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin right now -- justin was beginning to get his youtube .
no one has to give your green light .
and today we all feel like all of our pop culture .
and these aren & apos ; t the characteristics of old media and they don & apos ; t meet the media of today , but they & apos ; re going to tell the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i stand here in 10 minutes about the connection between women talking about three , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness < unk > in a four year-old girl , when she came across 30 years ago with her little sister and her grandmother , in the middle of a chinese restaurant , in the long day .
the story is not finished yet .
she & apos ; s a puzzle that & apos ; s still being put together .
i & apos ; d like to tell you about some of the < unk > .
imagine the first panel : a man who burning his life .
he & apos ; s a poet , an author , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of oneness and freedom of its home .
keep him in mind at the < unk > of the < unk > in < unk > , trying to figure out that his life had been a waste of waste .
the words , as long as his friends , < unk > now of his .
he went back to silence .
he died ; he died through the story .
it & apos ; s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten me for his life .
i had to worry that it wasn & apos ; t for nothing , and it was my task to learn that history was trying to < unk > us , but it was through .
the next is < unk > , shows a boat in the early part of the lake , < unk > < unk > .
my mother may have been 18 , when her father died -- already in an < unk > marriage , with two little girls .
for them , life had asked her a task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
there was absolutely no idea that she could fail .
after a four year-olds and < unk > < unk > , there & apos ; s a boat quiet onto the lake as a < unk > .
all the adults were really aware of the risks .
most people were terrified of pirate , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little < unk > on herself .
at a time , my sister would have just been < unk > , and i , you know , i & apos ; m going to drink my grandmother of it .
my first memories are from the boat -- the always form of the engine , the clap one wave of every wave on the front , the long and warm horizon .
i don & apos ; t remember the pirate supply that a lot of times , but took from the man to the boat on the boat , or on the < unk > of the engine , he didn & apos ; t want to take six hours to do it .
but i remember the lights in front of the coast of < unk > , and on the young man , who went off and died , the end of the trip was too much for him , and the taste of the first < unk > , which gave me a platform of the men .
no apple ever did that kind of thing again .
after three months in a refugee camps , we landed in pop .
and the next generation is about four women in three generations building together to build a new life .
we went down to < unk > area , which was one of the working-class people who moved out of < unk > & apos ; s population of < unk > .
unlike the < unk > < unk > , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no < unk > in < unk > .
the smells of the earth & apos ; s < unk > came from the rest of the world .
and the < unk > broken together were hit between people who had one thing in common : they began new .
my mother worked on farms farms , then on an assembly line in a < unk > , six days , double < unk > .
she was somehow able to find the time to come out of english and to give birth to her .
we were poor .
every dollar was tried , and they put into other education for english and math no matter what we had to do for it , most of the time was the new thing that came out of the second hand .
two pair of < unk > for school , each , to < unk > holes in the other .
so it took us up to the < unk > , because it had to reach six years .
and there were the rare painful colors of & quot ; < unk > & quot ; and here and < unk > & apos ; s , & quot ; next door , go home . & quot ;
where & apos ; s the home ?
something < unk > inside of me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation , and there was a calm voice saying , & quot ; i & apos ; m going to take you out of the way . & quot ;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were telling each other about our day , and we were listening to the movements of our grandmother .
my mom was suffering from the boat .
and my job was to keep up every night until your < unk > came to wake up to wake them up .
it opened up a business plan , then an < unk > plan and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don & apos ; t change the change , angry and angry , and < unk > kids , captured between two worlds .
loans and sponsors became looked for nothing .
centers were built .
i lived in < unk > .
in one , i was the classical asian student who introduced < unk > need for himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in other people & apos ; s lives , the tragic scars of the violence , the < unk > and the < unk > .
but this got a lot of help from the years .
and that & apos ; s because of the help i was trained in my last year of < unk > as a boy named < unk > of the year .
and i was raised by one < unk > of the next , and the edges didn & apos ; t fit together .
< unk > le < unk > by < unk > , a from ted conference , refugee and social activist and social activist that were invited to places that you & apos ; ve never heard , and in action that existence you & apos ; ve never imagined .
i wasn & apos ; t familiar with < unk > .
i didn & apos ; t know how to use the < unk > .
i had no idea how to talk about wine .
i had no idea how to talk about anything .
i wanted to come back to the routine and the convenience of a unknown act of unknown < unk > -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were < unk > as their days as 20 years , who were telling each other & apos ; s stories , and we & apos ; re always talking about three in the same space .
i told my mother , i wouldn & apos ; t do it .
she reminded me that i was now as old as she then , when we had climbed out the boat .
no had never been a chance .
& quot ; just do it , & quot ; she said . & quot ; and don & apos ; t be what you & apos ; re not . & quot ;
so i talked about < unk > and < unk > and < unk > and < unk > .
and the more open i talked , the more i should go .
i met people all over the place , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the boundaries of the possible .
and when i graduated from college , i realized that i couldn & apos ; t take a career in law .
there had to be another < unk > .
and i realized at the same time that it & apos ; s okay to be a there , a < unk > , new in the picture -- not just okay , but something that you have to be grateful to , maybe a gift of < unk > .
because < unk > can make the collapse so easy to collapse , easily meaning that you get the assumptions of the environment .
i & apos ; ve gone enough from my local shop to know that , yes , world is < unk > , but not the way you throw it down .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were encouraged by hand .
there was a energy , a < unk > optimism , a strange < unk > of humility and humility .
so i joined my gut reaction .
i collected a small team of people around me who are not < unk > to a < unk > challenge .
one year we had no cents .
i < unk > a still , at the end of a still , a huge soup that we shared .
we were working late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant people in it , and we managed the breakthrough .
i made the decision to go to the u.s .
after just one journey there .
my feeling again .
three months later , i moved on , and the adventure continued to happen .
and before i give you a talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when the social norm was the social norm and the local people were the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after you were born .
her mother did it all on her own .
at age 17 , she became a woman & apos ; s second lady to beat her .
without her husband , she was doing a < unk > job by killing him in court and < unk > in her own case , and an even larger health experience than she won .
it & apos ; s not about as < unk > < unk > .
i just < unk > in a hotel room at sydney when she died ; 1,000 miles away in inner .
i looked through the < unk > , and i saw them standing on the other side .
i knew she had come back to pass .
my mom called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in < unk > , and we sat at their well .
we told their stories , and we told them we were still with them .
and he went to midnight , and he said , & quot ; he & apos ; s got to close the come . & quot ;
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , & quot ; why is your hand so warm and the rest of it you is so cold ? & quot ;
& quot ; because they & apos ; ve been keeping you this morning , & quot ; he said .
& quot ; you & apos ; re not really left . & quot ;
if there & apos ; s a band in our family , it & apos ; s going to be run by women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men , who might have come to our lives would have come to us back to life .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i wish i had my own kids , and i & apos ; m still thinking about the boat .
who & apos ; s ever going to want one ?
yeah , i & apos ; m scared of privilege , done by ease , before < unk > .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous wave of every wave , the < unk > , the < unk > , the < unk > of the engine , the horizon , who doesn & apos ; t guarantee ?
i don & apos ; t know .
but if i could do that , i & apos ; d certainly shake it forward , i & apos ; d .
furthermore , < unk > mother here today is in the fourth or fifth row .
i & apos ; m here to share my photography with you .
so is it even photography ?
because that & apos ; s , of course , a picture you can & apos ; t take with your camera .
but still , my interest in photography when i first received my first digital camera , at the age of 15 .
i put it together with my earlier preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because the camera was basically the process in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you press it on you .
so to me , it seemed more like that to be about this , at the right place to be at the right time .
i thought everybody could .
so i wanted to create something different , something that the process starts when the trigger goes off .
photos like this : a site , along a much < unk > road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic space .
or photos like this -- dark and < unk > , but also keeping people together with the common goal , to keep an realistic plane .
when i say reality , i mean < unk > .
because , of course , it & apos ; s not something you can actually capture , but i always want to make it look like it had been , in a picture .
pictures where you have to think of a moment in order to get the trick out of it .
so it & apos ; s more about putting an idea than really do a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about lights ?
what & apos ; s creating an illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is an illusion .
but ultimately , it & apos ; s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be built on a two-dimensional area .
it & apos ; s not about what is realistic , it & apos ; s what we think is realistic .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we & apos ; ve got three perfectly < unk > < unk > objects that we can identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that still looks like it might exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we < unk > our brains , because the brain doesn & apos ; t really make sense of it , because it doesn & apos ; t really make sense .
and i see the same process combining taking pictures .
it & apos ; s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make up a very realistic picture , i think it & apos ; s the things we don & apos ; t think about that we think are around us in our daily lives .
but if we take photographs , it & apos ; s really important to think about it , because otherwise it just looks wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
and as you can see , these aren & apos ; t three special pictures .
but you can put something special on the create .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , they should have had the same < unk > .
and these two pictures fulfill these two demands -- shooting at the same altitude , doing the same amount of energy .
third , it & apos ; s not just about making it impossible to tell you where the individual paintings begin and end by connecting them together as a < unk > .
there & apos ; s no way that the photo was actually put together .
so by < unk > , contrast and < unk > at the edge of the individual images , photographic them together , like < unk > , < unk > colors , and < unk > , we & apos ; re leaving the boundaries between the various images and making it look like a picture of a single , even a picture .
here & apos ; s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part is manipulated .
but this image is actually completely put together , < unk > pictures of different places .
personally , i make sure it & apos ; s easier to create a place , like , a place to find a location , because you don & apos ; t have to take compromise into your ideas .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i needed several months to plan to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a < unk > .
the bank was from another place .
the < unk > comes from a now .
and yeah , i even put the house up on the top of the island to make it look swedish .
so to get to a certain result , i believe it & apos ; s walking out of planning .
i always start with a < unk > , an idea .
and then it & apos ; s about the combination of all the different pictures .
and here , every piece of planned is very good .
and then if you do good images , the outcome can be pretty neat , and pretty realistic .
so , it & apos ; s all the tools there , and the only thing that & apos ; s limited to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i & apos ; d love to talk to you about why there & apos ; s so many electronic fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced to the design world was to take away a < unk > .
now , this isn & apos ; t particularly scientifically -- it & apos ; s a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , & quot ; how is it ? & quot ;
how can we help you ? & quot ;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- perhaps most of the electronic learning opportunities : because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite . this is a very simple thing .
it & apos ; s got a button , right ?
and every morning i stop .
and yeah , i have a task as you might recognize it .
i & apos ; ve done my job with 95 pounds .
it & apos ; s working very simply : every time i hit the scale , they & apos ; re sending my data on google health .
and that & apos ; s where they & apos ; re also being < unk > by my < unk > , so that he can recognize where i & apos ; m going , not just in the moment that i & apos ; m going to support for , that i & apos ; m going to look at the past .
but there & apos ; s something else .
maybe you & apos ; re familiar with this , i & apos ; ve been < unk > on 4,000 < unk > of twitter .
so every morning i & apos ; m getting out of school , and people are talking to me before i & apos ; m sitting in a car , & quot ; i & apos ; d rather just a lettuce here today , < unk > . & quot ;
but this is the < unk > thing that can happen because this is < unk > , < unk > , to help patients , because this could be used against obesity , or it could smoke patients .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play some kind of game to control their health .
next week , it depends on the market .
there & apos ; ll be this little < unk > that you put on an iphone or something .
and it & apos ; s going to enable people to measure their blood pressure from home , to send it to their physician and share it for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , patients come into the game . they can & apos ; t just take over the control , the captain on their own ship , but can help us with the health care of the challenges that are facing us , and the health care costs , the public health care , the scale .
make techniques easy to use and start doing this with this on the team , giving patients a hug .
and you can get through those techniques , but < unk > .
and one of the things we & apos ; ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the car companies in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know very closely where all machines around the world are located .
we know one more where all the stations are .
and sure , we can find < unk > .
but where would the next patient be to help this patient ?
we & apos ; ve got < unk > , and no one & apos ; s really sure .
no one knew where the nearest < unk > was at that moment .
so , what did we do ? we < unk > in the netherlands .
we set up a website and we asked a < unk > , & quot ; if you see a < unk > , please share this with us when he & apos ; s on , & quot ; because sometimes he & apos ; s closed , of course .
and over 10,000 species of rock were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we created an design competition .
we & apos ; ve developed an app for < unk > , extended reality to find these < unk > .
and if you & apos ; re in a city like < unk > and somebody , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks your < unk > to find the next < unk > that can save lives .
and today , we & apos ; d like to take this not just as a < unk > , what the product calls itself , but also consider to be a < unk > .
and we & apos ; d like to bring this to a global level .
and we & apos ; re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like < unk > , to < unk > these < unk > around the world .
and when they & apos ; re on vacation , and somebody & apos ; s next to you , they & apos ; re your personal < unk > or somebody else , they can find a < unk > .
the other thing we & apos ; d like to ask for is that companies around the world are helping us with this < unk > thing .
this could be < unk > , or a technician , just to make sure that the < unk > is still in its place .
please help us do that and try to improve your health , not just to improve , but to your hand .
thank you .
today i & apos ; m going to report some unexpected discoveries .
i work in medical school .
and my little < unk > would like us to make environmental issues by ...
... < unk > speaking .
here & apos ; s a quick video of what we & apos ; re doing .
oh . a moment .
it may take you before it & apos ; s actually sent over .
now -- we can just skip that -- i & apos ; m just going to skip the video instead ...
no .
this is not ...
okay .
< unk > is ...
oh my time is up ?
ok . thanks .
so a few years ago , i & apos ; ve launched a program to get stars in technology and design design , to take a year off , and to work in an environment that sort of < unk > everything you really hate , we & apos ; ve done in government .
the program is called & quot ; code for america & quot ; and it & apos ; s a little bit like the < unk > for part .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with < unk > .
instead of sending them to the third world , we & apos ; re sending them to < unk > .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what is possible today with technology .
so let & apos ; s meet al .
al is a < unk > village in boston .
here it looks like he & apos ; s looking for a date , but what he & apos ; s really looking for is somebody looking at him , if he & apos ; s < unk > , he knows , he & apos ; s not very good at the < unk > of a snow in the snow .
how did he get there looking for this particular way of looking for help ?
we had a team from boston last year in boston , and we had the code for america & apos ; s program .
you & apos ; ve been there in february , and there & apos ; s been a lot of < unk > there .
and they realized that the city never < unk > this fire < unk > .
but one particular fellow , a guy called erik < unk > , and he noticed something else , and that was that the residents were < unk > out of the experience directly , right before these parts .
so he did what any good engineers would do , he wrote an app .
it & apos ; s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you & apos ; re too < unk > to < unk > if it & apos ; s < unk > .
if you do this , you can give him a name , and he called the first al gore .
if you don & apos ; t do that , anybody can take it off .
so there & apos ; s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a very small app .
it & apos ; s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written last year .
but she does something that doesn & apos ; t do other business .
it & apos ; s rapidly spreading .
there & apos ; s this guy in the < unk > section of the city , who & apos ; s seen that he can use this app , not for snow , but to adopt citizens & apos ; citizens .
it & apos ; s very important that these < unk > work , but people steal the batteries .
this is how he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to < unk > the citizens .
and chicago has just launched it so people are < unk > it if it & apos ; s < unk > .
we & apos ; re now familiar with nine cities that are planning to make these app .
and it turns out to be specific , organic , of course .
if you know anything about < unk > , you know it & apos ; s not usually going on .
software usually takes a couple of years to run a couple of years .
we had a team that was working on a project in boston for three and a half months .
it was about a way in which parents can find out which the right public schools for their children .
we later became told that if it was going to go on over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and there & apos ; s nothing left .
there & apos ; s now a project in the california law that & apos ; s going to cost the for two billion dollars now , and it doesn & apos ; t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that & apos ; s written in a few days , and then spread from < unk > is a kind of shot in front of the bug at the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not how a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not like a < unk > , it & apos ; s like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and this is important .
but more importantly to that app is that it represents a new generation that < unk > the problem of government -- not as a problem of an institution of institution , but as a collective action of collective action .
and that & apos ; s a very good news , because it turns out that we & apos ; re very good at collective digital technology .
there & apos ; s now a large community of people who make the tools we need to make things effective together .
it & apos ; s not just & quot ; code for america , & quot ; there are hundreds of people in the entire country writing up and writing < unk > writing every day in their own communities .
they didn & apos ; t give up government .
they & apos ; re terribly frustrated with it , but they don & apos ; t complain about it , they fix it .
and these people know something we lost out of the eyes .
and that & apos ; s when you & apos ; re actually all talking about your feelings about politics and the snake line and all the other things that we & apos ; re really upset about is in the core , in the words of tim o & apos ; t we can do that together .
today , a lot of people have given up on the government .
and if you & apos ; re one of those people , i & apos ; m going to ask you that you & apos ; re talking about this , because things are going to change .
the politics doesn & apos ; t change ; the government is changing .
and because the government finally < unk > its force from us -- gives you , & quot ; we & apos ; re the people ? & quot ; how we think about this is going to affect how this change happens .
i didn & apos ; t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought that the government was mostly about choosing people in office .
now , after two years , i & apos ; ve come to conclude that it is all about communities to be seen as < unk > .
that & apos ; s the call center for service and information .
that & apos ; s where you typically get out , when you walk into your city .
if you ever have a chance to work in your < unk > call center , like our fellow scott < unk > as part of the program -- in fact , they do all -- you will see that people , because of the government , there & apos ; s a lot of these problems , including it .
scott , so i & apos ; m getting this < unk > .
he & apos ; s sending & quot ; < unk > & quot ; into the official database .
and he didn & apos ; t really have an idea . he starts with the < unk > .
and finally , he says , & quot ; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and very loud music and see if the cattle is being covered ? & quot ;
and that worked . round for scott .
but that wasn & apos ; t the end of the line .
boston didn & apos ; t just have a call center .
it & apos ; s got a app called < unk > and < unk > , called < unk > < unk > .
we didn & apos ; t write that app .
this is the work of very smart people in the office of & quot ; new york city & quot ; in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in : & quot ; < unk > in my < unk > . can & apos ; t say she & apos ; s dead .
how do i get it removed ? & quot ;
but what & apos ; s happening with < unk > < unk > is different .
scott lot of people changed .
but in & quot ; < unk > < unk > , & quot ; everything in the public is so that anybody can see it .
and in this case , this was a neighbor .
and the next entry we got was , & quot ; i went over there , found the < unk > behind the house .
alive ? yes . alive ? < unk > .
turned it upside down . went home .
good night , honey < unk > . & quot ;
pretty simple .
that & apos ; s great . here & apos ; s the digital thing .
and it & apos ; s also a good example of how government can be < unk > .
but it & apos ; s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don & apos ; t necessarily mean a technological definition of the platform here .
i talk more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
citizens helped another citizens , but the government played a central role here .
they joined those two people .
and you could have been able to connect them with government policies if they were required , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper , economic services .
if a neighbor to the other part is what we empower our communities .
don & apos ; t call the < unk > , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things about this is that we need to think about it , is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that & apos ; s the input from others .
this is what our contribution to the system is .
how many times did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we sit back and we expect the government to reflect our values and our needs and then doesn & apos ; t change ?
that & apos ; s because the government like the farther ocean is and politics are the supreme < unk > .
and what & apos ; s underneath it is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use that word with contempt like that .
but it & apos ; s this contempt , who have this thing we have , and we have to pay for , something that works against us , something else , and then we < unk > ourselves .
people seem to think that politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that & apos ; s where the real building industry is happening .
we need to get up to the machinery of government .
so , < unk > did it .
did you see these guys ?
it & apos ; s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed report on the report of the report , which is an answer to the < unk > < unk > .
it & apos ; s not very politically active , it & apos ; s < unk > active .
now , for those of us who have given up the government , it & apos ; s time for us to think about the world that we want to leave our kids .
you & apos ; ve got to imagine the enormous challenges they & apos ; ve had to face .
do we really believe that we need to achieve what we need to do without improving an institution that can operate in the names of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology enables government to basic the function of government in a fundamental way that can actually do something by bringing society to the society .
and there & apos ; s a generation that & apos ; s grown up the internet , and it knows that it & apos ; s not that hard to do things together ; you just have to build systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i & apos ; m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up learning to see her voice as a granted .
they & apos ; re not fighting to fight that we & apos ; re all fighting , that & apos ; s why we can talk ; they & apos ; re all allowed to talk .
they can make their opinions at every channel at any time , and they do .
so , if you & apos ; re faced with the government problem , don & apos ; t worry about using your voices this way .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government .
and this apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be , a fire < unk > < unk > , a trash house , a trash house , a like a < unk > .
and i & apos ; m sure that we could have brought those fire machines around , and a lot of people do it .
but these apps are like small digital memory that we & apos ; re not only consumers , and we & apos ; re not only consumers of government who are paying taxes and services .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we & apos ; re not going to improve government , until we improve the citizenship .
so the question that i have for all of you is , when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , we & apos ; re just going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role in telling people how wonderful are the new technologies that are going to be on the rise , and i thought , as i & apos ; m here , i would tell you what i really am , and i & apos ; m going to go back and see this amazing thing .
i & apos ; m going to start with just a little , boring slide .
... could you just show the slide for a minute ?
this is a slide which i happen to choose from my folder .
i & apos ; m not talking about the details of the slide , but about the general form .
this slide shows us an analysis of an analysis about the performance of < unk > processors compared to the performance of an equal area .
what & apos ; s interesting here is that this slide , like so < unk > others , which we often find in our field , are a kind of like a < unk > curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a power < unk > .
and that & apos ; s one thing we need to use this guy scale up on < unk > curves around the area of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is basically what i & apos ; m going to talk about .
so , please turn the lights back up .
a little bit better , because i & apos ; m going to draw something like that on paper here .
now , why do we draw graph in technology on < unk > curves ?
the reason for that is , if i drawing it on a regular curve , where we say , well , that & apos ; s the time , so the timeline of a species , and this is a big stage of technology , which i want to show with a graph , then computer graph .
they look like this .
and that doesn & apos ; t really tell us very much .
now , if i & apos ; d like to map another technology , let & apos ; s say a line of color , it would come from the < unk > scale very < unk > , in a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes < unk > circumstances .
so if the < unk > process was as fast as the current progression of progress , then we could get < unk > into a taxi , and in 30 seconds we were in tokyo .
but that & apos ; s not so fast .
we & apos ; ve never had that in the history of < unk > , that kind of < unk > growth , which is increasing all of the scale of exponentially every few years .
the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at these exponential curves , you can see they & apos ; re not going on forever .
it & apos ; s not possible that everything evolves forever and forever as fast as it is now .
and there are two options .
either it will be a classic < unk > like this until something completely new < unk > , or it will happen .
so it & apos ; s something like this .
well , i & apos ; m an understanding , so i think something like this is going to happen in the way that & apos ; s going to happen .
that & apos ; s the real thing , and that means we & apos ; re right there in the middle of a transition .
we are here on this line , in a transition from past world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also think of myself as well , is , how is this new world going to be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to it when you & apos ; re in the middle .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and it shows that the future is still around 2000 .
next to that we don & apos ; t move .
so in other words , the future < unk > every year for a year since i was on this world .
i think the reason for this is because we discover something is happening .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
and we know right now that it & apos ; s simply not making sense of 30 or 50 years into the future because everything is going to be so different , that a simple line of what we & apos ; re doing is just making no sense .
i & apos ; d like to talk now about what that might be , this transition that we & apos ; re at the moment .
to do that i & apos ; ll first talk about some other things that really don & apos ; t have anything to do with technology or computers .
because i think in order to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and that & apos ; s one that i & apos ; d like to look at on the surface of the earth & apos ; s life .
i think the big picture makes sense , if you < unk > it into some < unk > .
so let & apos ; s go back , and that was 2.5 billion years , that the earth was a big , < unk > < unk > for lots of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then there & apos ; s a pretty good image of how they feel about it .
i think there are theories that are starting to understand how it started with rna , but i & apos ; m going to tell you a little story about it , which is a very small , at that time , < unk > < unk > , that < unk > different kinds of information for chemicals .
some of these build a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside , and grow into it .
everybody who were that way began to learn .
these little creatures in the sense were the < unk > < unk > .
but these oil prices weren & apos ; t about living in the world today because each one of them was just a small , < unk > recipe for chemicals .
and every time it divided , the ones that have < unk > chemicals at the bottom have < unk > levels .
so each < unk > was a little different .
in fact , the < unk > , which had one for the growth of the scale of growth worked faster than others and more chemicals and more chemicals from outside and shared it faster .
so these < unk > are going to survive longer , and they were < unk > in a much better way .
so that & apos ; s just a very simple chemical form of life , but it & apos ; s more interesting when these < unk > learned a trick about abstraction .
in some way that we don & apos ; t fully understand , these < unk > have learned the ability to use information .
they & apos ; ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and that is in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , in this evolutionary process , evolutionary style , they found a way to allow you to predict what they were made of so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing is that this kind of information can be store over the period of 2.5 billion years into which it appeared .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the exact same code and the same notation .
and every being , every being , uses exactly the same letter , the same code .
we & apos ; re as far as we can , just to the < unk > , ourselves , be able to write this code .
and i & apos ; ve got 100 < unk > of a white < unk > , which i & apos ; ve been trying to stay away from the airports of < unk > .
what i & apos ; ve done is , what i & apos ; ve taken this code -- the code is made up of regular letter , which we use to the < unk > -- and i & apos ; ve written my dna map on a piece and i & apos ; ve made it 10 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my body mass , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for anyone in the world , and it & apos ; s right there .
in fact , if i & apos ; d been a < unk > , i would have written them on a virus and put them in the room .
so what & apos ; s the next step ?
the dna genome project was an interesting step .
and the < unk > these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another interesting step came , very interesting step where things were completely different , and these cells started communicating and sharing information so communities have come from cells .
i don & apos ; t know if you knew that already , but bacteria can actually replace your dna .
now that & apos ; s also why we & apos ; re going to grow against antibiotics , for example .
some bacteria figured out how to get away from penicillin and put that information together with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate .
now this communication allowed the reasons of communities , which were , in a certain sense , in the same boat ; they were < unk > .
so they survived it either together , or they walked together , and that means that if a community was successful , all the individuals in the community were repeated more and more of evolution .
now the < unk > is where these communities are so close together that they decided to put the recipe for the whole community into a < unk > cell .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at that point we have < unk > communities , communities of many different < unk > communities that act together as individual organism .
in fact , we & apos ; re also such a < unk > community .
we have many cells that are not alone .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , and so on .
so these communities began to evolve so the level at which evolution was on , no longer the single cell , but the whole < unk > that we call organism .
now the next step happened in these communities .
the < unk > started recording information .
and they developed special structures that didn & apos ; t do anything else but process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are really the kind of neurons that these types of neurons built .
they started to form on specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , and capture from information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point an individual -- learning happened in the time of an organism , rather than this evolutionary period .
so an organism , for example , could learn to eat a certain amount of fruit , because she liked badly and made him sick , the last time he & apos ; d eaten it .
now , this could have happened in the lifetime of a single organism while it took hundreds of thousands of years , because these evolutionary information had to be learned by the individuals that died because of this fruit , because these < unk > were not there yet .
so the nervous system has been in the < unk > process in this particular way , because evolution was now able to take place in an individual place .
it could happen in a time dimension .
what happened then is that individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
let & apos ; s take the example , the < unk > version of this data set is human language .
it & apos ; s quite an amazing invention to think about it .
i have a very complicated , < unk > and < unk > idea in my head .
i & apos ; m sitting here and i & apos ; m basically call < unk > sounds of me in the hope to create a similar idea in your head that has a certain idea with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , transform it into sound , create a sequence of sound , and we make something very complicated in the minds of others .
so this allows us to again as a unified organism to work .
and what we & apos ; ve actually done is we & apos ; ve started to < unk > our human race .
we & apos ; re going to go through the same steps that < unk > have been through -- the abstraction of our methods , like we & apos ; re holding data , we & apos ; re presenting .
for example , the invention of language has been a small step in that direction .
< unk > , computers , < unk > , < unk > , and so on , are our functional mechanisms that we & apos ; ve built in our community to handle this information .
and it also connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and it & apos ; s able to evolve faster than we are so far .
so today , evolution can happen at the time of microseconds .
you also saw < unk > little like < unk > where he showed a little evolution in & quot ; < unk > & quot ; programs right there in front of your eyes .
so now we & apos ; ve got the < unk > again .
the first steps of the story i told you , < unk > a billion years every piece .
next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , for several hundred million years .
steps then , steps , like language and so on , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , may seem to be a few decades .
the process is feeding itself , and so i think , < unk > is the word for it -- if something becomes more complicated .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that & apos ; s what we & apos ; re seeing here in this < unk > curve .
we see the process that < unk > itself .
i live away from the building of computers , and i know i & apos ; m using the mechanism i & apos ; m using to build computers , not , without the recent progress of computer computing .
my current activity in designing objects like that is such a high complexity that it & apos ; s impossible for me to design them in the traditional mind .
i don & apos ; t know what makes every single transistor in the back .
it & apos ; s got billions of them .
what i & apos ; m doing instead , and what & apos ; s happening is , we think of a certain kind of < unk > , < unk > that machine and the machine does something that far beyond our ability , better and faster than we can .
and she does it in part with techniques that we don & apos ; t even understand until now .
a method that & apos ; s particularly interesting , and which i & apos ; ve been using a lot of time , is evolution itself .
there & apos ; s an < unk > on the machine that & apos ; s in the < unk > .
to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that & apos ; s built out of random instructions .
we say , & quot ; computers , < unk > please have a hundred million randomly chosen design sequences .
now , please lead all of these randomly chosen instructions , take on all the programs , and finally choose the ones that i & apos ; m most likely to get . & quot ;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let & apos ; s say i want numbers , that would be a simple example that i & apos ; ve used for this .
so it & apos ; s a set of programs that can very easily sort of < unk > the numbers .
of course , the chance in randomly chosen instructions is very small , because they sort of < unk > numbers at chance , so i don & apos ; t think that & apos ; s going to actually do this .
but one of these may be happy with some two numbers in the right order .
now i say , & quot ; computers , take those 10 percent of those sequences that are my down to the next point .
you store these , you store the rest .
now there & apos ; s all the < unk > that the numbers do best .
and this was one way to do it , analog to reproduction . & quot ;
take two programs and they & apos ; re producing kids through the exchange of their < unk > , and kids were < unk > the traits of those programs from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that evolved through combinations of programs that came to a little closer to < unk > than others .
say , & quot ; please repeat this process . & quot ;
bring it back back .
run , maybe a few mutations .
and try again a whole different generation .
all those generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can let a evolution go over millions of years in the computer , in a matter of minutes , or in more complicated cases , a few hours .
and finally , i get programs that can get numbers perfectly .
in fact , those programs are so much more efficient than any program i would have ever written by hand .
and then if i look at these programs , i can & apos ; t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it & apos ; s huge and strange programs .
but they do it .
i know , and i & apos ; m sure they & apos ; ll get that job done because they come from a series of < unk > programs that did the job .
because her life was covered by whether they were going to get that job right .
i used to sit in a 747 with < unk > , and he used to < unk > a map and say , & quot ; oh look at this . look at this .
it says , & apos ; that airplane is made up of < unk > < unk > , which together to make your flight safer . & apos ; doesn & apos ; t make you < unk > ? & quot ;
we know that while it & apos ; s not optimal , we don & apos ; t know if it & apos ; s too complicated .
so we & apos ; re starting to rely on computers , a process that & apos ; s very different from the classic engineering approach .
it allows us to create stuff with a much greater complexity than the normal methods to produce .
and yet we don & apos ; t really understand the possibilities of it yet .
so , technology projects don & apos ; t help us with this technology .
we & apos ; re now using these programs to make the computer much faster , so we & apos ; re able to perform these processes even faster .
and so there & apos ; s a < unk > there .
it & apos ; s faster and faster , and i think that & apos ; s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding themselves today , all of them .
we raise the < unk > .
we & apos ; ve come to a point when we & apos ; ve gone back then , when < unk > evolved to be a < unk > .
so we & apos ; re the < unk > , and we can & apos ; t quite make any of what the hell we & apos ; re doing here .
we & apos ; re in the middle of that room .
but i really think that after we get there .
i think it & apos ; s quite a strange thing for us to say that we are the art of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
well , lunch is before i think i & apos ; m going to stop listening before i & apos ; m still going to be < unk > .
my story starts right there in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was together under the sky in the desert with < unk > < unk > ali .
we were talking about < unk > , which has changed since the time of the ancient indian < unk > .
at the time , if we wanted to travel back , we would start putting ourselves in a car and throw up above the sky .
now we do it by planes .
back then , when the great indian < unk > < unk > was < unk > , he took a bow , pulled out into the soil and the water .
now we & apos ; re doing it with < unk > and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got a little scared of technology .
it scared me that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without tweet to my friends .
i found technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver < unk > .
this piece of old technology was the most beautiful thing for me .
she became a < unk > access to a world full of pirate and < unk > ships and images in my mind .
i came to think of it as though we were sending out our fancy clocks project and cameras to take up .
they were very inspired to be inspired by that .
and so i went out to the world of technology to see how i could use them to kill magic rather than killing them .
16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling that can connect readers across the world .
it can tell us how to keep it .
it can know where we are .
it & apos ; s taken pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
so it always uses more and more senses .
but what we do is actually this .
i & apos ; m just going to < unk > , an interactive app system .
it says , & quot ; put your finger on any light . & quot ;
and so -- it says , & quot ; this box is written ... & quot ; because i write my name .
and out of me is a character in the book .
and again , a letter for me down -- and the ipad knows , through gps , where i live -- that & apos ; s right to jump towards me .
and the kid in me is really , really excited about this .
i & apos ; ve talked a lot about magic .
i don & apos ; t mean the magic with it , the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i always found quite exciting .
so you & apos ; ve got to kind of < unk > the ipad in it and pull it off .
and let & apos ; s go through the book of personal computers .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can pop into a single galaxy .
and so every book , every book and every world is going to be a little < unk > that i & apos ; m going to put here on the magic thing .
and this opens up a map .
maps had always had maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows , and it acts like orientation in the rest of the book .
it also turns out to be in other places in the book .
i & apos ; m just taking this .
and also , it & apos ; s important for me to create something that is < unk > , but it & apos ; s also very sophisticated .
so these are the < unk > < unk > .
we & apos ; ve all heard of < unk > and < unk > , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues who are < unk > ?
the poor city of < unk > were thousands of years in < unk > chambers , in an old < unk > book .
and we take it back in a contemporary story for kids .
one story that < unk > with new issues like < unk > .
for example , a big problem facing the last 10 years is that kids are in their own rooms , they go ahead with their computers .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you & apos ; re sent to a search . you have to go out and get the camera to collect natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of < unk > , stones , < unk > and < unk > .
somehow kids don & apos ; t do it anymore .
this is < unk > . you have to go out and you have to go to a chapter that & apos ; s a flower and mark it .
in another chapter , you have to play a piece of < unk > and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can then put online .
a human child in london shows the image of a heat and says , & quot ; oh , i & apos ; ve seen a fox . & quot ;
a kid in india says , & quot ; i have seen a monkeys today . & quot ;
this creates a social network around a digital collection of photos that you & apos ; ve actually photographed .
there are a number of ways of bringing magic , the world and technology together .
so in the next book , we & apos ; re planning to have an interaction with which we & apos ; re using this video from < unk > reality , and we & apos ; re seeing an animation from < unk > , which appears on a plant in front of the house .
one , it & apos ; s like , you know , they & apos ; re < unk > with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the < unk > , blow it away and read the rest of the book .
we & apos ; re all moving to a world where the natural forces of technology can come closer and closer to magic and technology can come .
we use the energy of sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and on the magic and fun , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in < unk > , prisons or < unk > .
i spend most of my time < unk > in the < unk > and places in the places where there are lots of despair .
here at ted to be able to see and to listen to what the no need to have given me very much force .
in the short time here , i realized one thing : ted has an identity .
you can say things here that have influence in the world .
and sometimes , if there & apos ; s anything about ted , there & apos ; s a importance and force that it doesn & apos ; t otherwise .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we & apos ; ve learned that the words in a teacher & apos ; s words have meaning , but the words of a dedicated , < unk > particularly meaningful , are meaningful .
if you & apos ; re a doctor , you can do good , but if you & apos ; re a physician , you can do more .
and so that & apos ; s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn & apos ; t learn this in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i was dominated by a family , a traditional < unk > household , which was dominated by a < unk > , and this < unk > was my grandmother .
she was a < unk > , strong woman , she had an effect .
she had the last word in every case of everyone .
and she was also the start of a lot of differences in our family .
she was a girl & apos ; s daughter .
their parents were born in the < unk > in virginia as a slave .
she was born in would be born and the experience of slavery shaped their world in a lot strong ways .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came to me and she < unk > me .
and what hit me was that i could barely breathe , and she let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came to me and said , & quot ; < unk > , do you feel my embrace yet ? & quot ;
and if i said no , they kept telling me , & quot ; if i said , & quot ; let me calm it down .
she was something that made her that always wanted to be close to her .
the only problem it was she had 10 kids .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins walked around .
i remember i must have been eight or nine , that i woke up in a morning and went to the living room . everybody my cousins went around .
my grandmother ended up at the end of the day and started staring at me .
first i thought this would be a game .
i looked at it and smiling , but she looked very serious .
this went on for 15 or 20 minutes . she stood up and came over to me . she took me by my hand , and she said , & quot ; come , come on . you and i , we have to talk . & quot ;
i remember if it was yesterday .
i & apos ; ll never forget it .
she took me outside and said , & quot ; i & apos ; m going to tell you something , but you & apos ; ve got to promise you & apos ; re not going to < unk > it . & quot ;
i said , & quot ; i promised , & quot ; she said .
she said , & quot ; < unk > ? & quot ; i said , & quot ; yeah . & quot ;
she sat me down and looked at me . she said , & quot ; i want you to know i & apos ; ve noticed you . & quot ;
she said , & quot ; i think you & apos ; re special . & quot ;
she said , & quot ; i think you can do anything you want to do . & quot ;
i & apos ; ll never forget that .
she said , & quot ; you & apos ; ve got to promise me three things , < unk > . & quot ;
i said , & quot ; ok , grandmother . & quot ;
she said , & quot ; first thing , i & apos ; ll tell you that you & apos ; re going to love your mama . & quot ;
she said , & quot ; your mom is my baby and you have to promise you they & apos ; re always going to take care of . & quot ;
i mean my mother , so i said , & quot ; yes , grandmother , i & apos ; m going to . & quot ;
she said , & quot ; next thing you know , that you & apos ; re always going to do the right thing to do , & quot ; even though it & apos ; s hard to do the right thing . & quot ;
i was like , & quot ; yeah . i promise . & quot ;
after all , she said , & quot ; the last thing you & apos ; ve got to promise to me is , & quot ; you & apos ; re not going to drink alcohol . & quot ;
well , i was nine years old , so i said , & quot ; yes , grandmother . i promise . & quot ;
i grew up on the land in the old , rural south , and i have a brother as a year older and a year older sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and i took this < unk > beer with my sister and went and went with us in the forest .
we & apos ; re only < unk > around there , or something else .
then he took a beer and offered to my sister one , and she took it , and then she offered me one .
i said , & quot ; no , no , no . all right . just do you . i don & apos ; t want to make a beer . & quot ;
my brother said , & quot ; well let & apos ; s do this now , because you & apos ; re going to do everything we & apos ; re doing .
i had something you had . go . go get a beer . & quot ;
i said , & quot ; i don & apos ; t want it . just do . & quot ;
my brother was staring at me .
he said , & quot ; what & apos ; s going on with you ? well , what & apos ; s going on . & quot ;
and then he looked at his face , and he said , & quot ; oh no , you know , you & apos ; re not still going to go crazy because of the entertainment ? & quot ;
i said , & quot ; what are you talking about ? & quot ;
he said , & quot ; here & apos ; s a lot that you & apos ; re special . & quot ;
and i was devastated .
i & apos ; ll tell you something .
i don & apos ; t think i should do that .
this is perhaps in the public domain .
i & apos ; m 52 years old , and i remember i & apos ; ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i & apos ; m not saying that because i think it & apos ; s more important . i say that , because identity is force .
if we create the right kind of identity , then we can tell people around us things that they don & apos ; t believe in first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn & apos ; t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they & apos ; re special .
my grandfather was in prison during the < unk > .
my uncle died of okay , < unk > diseases .
and she believed these were the issues that we needed to care about .
i tried to say something about our space program .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
part of that was , six and a half thousand people were in < unk > and in jail .
today it & apos ; s 2.3 million .
the united states now has the highest taxes in the world .
seven million people have been released on < unk > or < unk > < unk > .
in my mind , < unk > changed the world profoundly .
in socially , social and black parts of the population , there are despair and despair , because of these changes .
one of three little black male between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , or with < unk > < unk > .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles , boston to washington -- 50 percent of the black men are either in prison , in prison , let alone < unk > or < unk > < unk > .
we & apos ; re not only < unk > by questions that have to do with < unk > , it & apos ; s also by poverty .
we have a < unk > in this country that & apos ; s treating them a lot better if they & apos ; re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
assets , not note , affect the outcome .
yet we seem to be quite pleased with that .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we & apos ; ve lost touch .
i find that interesting .
there are some < unk > developments .
my home office doesn & apos ; t change the < unk > when they & apos ; re convicted < unk > .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male population have lost their sexual < unk > .
we & apos ; ve found that in the last 10 years , the number of the < unk > of the civic < unk > will be as high as the < unk > of the < unk > < unk > .
they are silent is < unk > .
i < unk > kids .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the < unk > children of death in prison .
in this country , there & apos ; s very well for children to be < unk > without damage to each other .
we & apos ; ve already had a lot of change .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in < unk > .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we think because they & apos ; ve taught us that the real question is , did one person to die of him as a < unk > crime ?
it & apos ; s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not , did anybody make a crime to death , but , did we deserve to kill ?
which i find fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
nine people that we & apos ; ve executed have come to be one that we & apos ; ve been innocent off from death row and death row .
it & apos ; s an astonishing thing to do . it & apos ; s an astonishing one of nine .
which i find fascinating .
we & apos ; d never let anybody fly an airplane with an airplane , if you were to take nine airplanes , take a forward .
but somehow we can get away from this problem .
it & apos ; s not our problem .
it & apos ; s not our burden .
it & apos ; s not our fight .
i & apos ; m talking a lot about these questions .
i & apos ; m talking about race and the question we & apos ; re right to kill that .
and it & apos ; s exciting because i & apos ; m < unk > my students & apos ; emotional history . i & apos ; m talking about slavery .
i & apos ; m talking about terrorism , time against the end of the < unk > , until the beginning of the world war ii .
we don & apos ; t really know very much about this .
but for the oil spill in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas people have had to be scared of < unk > .
or bombs .
it was fear of terror that shaped your life .
these older people are coming up to me now and saying , & quot ; mr , they & apos ; re talking , they & apos ; re giving talks to people that they should stop saying we & apos ; re going to do it for the first time in the history of our nation , by september 11th . & quot ;
they say , & quot ; no , tell the people we grew up with this . & quot ;
and after terrorism , of course , the < unk > came < unk > and decades of < unk > and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don & apos ; t like to talk about our problems .
we don & apos ; t like to talk about our history .
and that & apos ; s why we don & apos ; t really understand what our actions are in historical context .
we are constantly < unk > .
we & apos ; re always < unk > new tensions and conflicts .
it & apos ; s hard for us to talk about race , and i think that & apos ; s because we & apos ; re not to be willing to get to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that < unk > is not to overcome the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was that willingness , but not in this country .
i gave some talks to germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , & quot ; you know , it & apos ; s deeply trivial to hear you speak . & quot ;
he said , & quot ; there & apos ; s no death penalty in germany .
and of course , in germany , there can never be more . & quot ;
there & apos ; s a silence , and then a woman said , & quot ; with our history , it & apos ; s impossible that we & apos ; re ever killing the systematic party of people . & quot ;
it would be aware of us , consciously and target people . & quot ;
i was thinking about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where the german state allowed people to live , especially if there were lots of jews .
it would be < unk > .
it would be < unk > .
and yet , here in this country , where in the ancient < unk > , we set people -- here & apos ; s the risk for death , 11 times higher if the victim is white , if it & apos ; s black , it & apos ; s black , it & apos ; s black , it & apos ; s black , it & apos ; s black .
and yet , there & apos ; s this mental institution .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don & apos ; t deal with those difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are affected too .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these realities are < unk > from suffering , abuse , < unk > .
i seem to be able to combine both .
because we talk about what we need more hope , more commitment , more commitment to be able to be in a complex world .
to me , this is the time to think and to talk about the poor , the vulnerable , the ones that will never be here at ted .
but thinking in a way that is integrated within our own life .
we all have to finally believe things that we can & apos ; t see .
we do that . and as rational as we are , we & apos ; re so excited .
innovation , creativity , development is not only coming from our heads .
they & apos ; re coming from ideas that are driven by persuasion in our hearts .
it & apos ; s this < unk > that i think that they & apos ; re driving us not just open to all the bright and < unk > things , but also for the dark and the dark .
< unk > < unk > , who & apos ; s the big , < unk > politician , once said .
when we were fighting in eastern europe , we wanted to be all sorts of possible , but what we needed most was hope , a kind of mental orientation that was sometimes to be in < unk > places and witness .
now , these spiritual orientation is the core of what i believe that the < unk > must be engaged in this .
there is no range of technology and design that allow us to be fully human and human , unless we don & apos ; t have eyes and ears for poverty , < unk > and < unk > .
i want to warn you , this kind of identity , a lot more of us than if we didn & apos ; t try .
it will deeply touch .
as a young lawyer , i have the privilege of creating pink parks .
parks always came back to < unk > , where they & apos ; ve had two of their oldest friends of these older women , < unk > < unk > , who had organized the < unk > -- an unbelievable < unk > -- and virginia , a white woman , whose husband .
so these women met and talked about these women .
and then < unk > < unk > me off and said , & quot ; < unk > , woman parks come to the town . we want to speak .
do you want to listen to each other and listen ? & quot ;
and i said , & quot ; yeah , i love . & quot ;
she said , & quot ; and what are you going to do if you & apos ; re here ? & quot ;
i said , & quot ; i & apos ; m going to listen . & quot ;
and i went over , and i just stopped .
it was always so inspiring , so < unk > .
and i sat there one day , and i heard these women , and after a few hours , the woman turned to me and said , & quot ; well , let & apos ; s say , & apos ; s say , & quot ; what & quot ; the initiative & quot ; is right .
what are you trying to do ? & quot ;
i started my usual talk .
i said , & quot ; we & apos ; re trying to make injustice .
trying to help people who were convicted of innocent people .
we want to fight bias and discrimination .
we want to < unk > < unk > without end < unk > for kids .
we want to do something against death row .
we want to lower the number of death row .
we want to break < unk > . & quot ;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and she said , & quot ; < unk > . < unk > . < unk > . & quot ;
she said , & quot ; this is going to make you very , very tired . & quot ;
and then , she rejected herself to me , put one finger on my face and said , & quot ; and that & apos ; s why you have to be very , very < unk > . & quot ;
and that & apos ; s why i think the ted community should be really big .
we & apos ; ve got to have some ways to think about these challenges : these problems , these suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on all of our humanity .
in my work , i & apos ; ve learned very simple things .
i & apos ; ve learned a couple of very simple things .
we & apos ; re all more than the worst thing we & apos ; ve ever done before .
i think that & apos ; s true for every human being on the planet .
when somebody & apos ; s lying , he & apos ; s not just a liars .
if somebody takes something that doesn & apos ; t hear it , it & apos ; s not just a move .
even who kills somebody is not just a murderer .
and because that is , there is a fundamental human dignity that need to respect the law .
i also think that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don & apos ; t think so .
i think in many places , this is the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i believe that even though it & apos ; s so dramatic and pretty and inspiring and so inspiring , we didn & apos ; t be measured at the end of our technology , not the things that we & apos ; re developing , not on our intellect and mind .
after all , a society isn & apos ; t measured how they & apos ; re rich and powerful and privileged , but rather , as they & apos ; re dealing with the poor , the < unk > , the < unk > .
because in that context , we are only beginning to understand the truly amazing things that are coming up .
sometimes i & apos ; m losing the balance . there & apos ; s a story to end .
sometimes i get too much .
i & apos ; m getting tired , we & apos ; re all going to .
sometimes these ideas get ahead of our thinking in a very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very hard punishment .
i go to the < unk > and visit a client that may be 13 or 14 years old , and which is to stand as an adult .
then i wonder : how could it happen ?
how can a judge turn into something that he isn & apos ; t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stopped , and i thought , oh my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , he & apos ; ll have to < unk > .
right , < unk > , the judge has < unk > .
you should wish too .
and because it was late , and i couldn & apos ; t really think anymore , i started working on a recent work .
i had an < unk > , poor black boy as a clients .
and i started off with this bill . the title was , & quot ; my poor , < unk > black out of it like a privileged , white , < unk > < unk > . & quot ;
in my continue , i explained that < unk > was the < unk > and the police and < unk > .
there was a crazy line about that in this country there & apos ; s nothing more < unk > about , that there & apos ; s only < unk > .
the next morning i woke up , and i couldn & apos ; t even tell if i was just writing this crazy excuse me , or was it actually written .
and to my horror , not only had i written him , but i sent him to the court .
a few months left , and i & apos ; d just forgotten about it .
so finally , i decided , oh my god , i & apos ; m going to go to court and see this crazy case .
i got in the car , and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought , this is so heavy , so painful .
finally , i got out of my car , and i went up the staircase to the court .
when i was < unk > the staircase , there was an older , black man , who was in the court .
and when he saw me , he came over to me and he said , & quot ; who are you ? & quot ;
i said , & quot ; i am a lawyer . & quot ; he said , & quot ; you & apos ; re a lawyer ? & quot ; i said , & quot ; yes . & quot ;
he came to me and < unk > me .
then he < unk > me in the ear .
he said , & quot ; i & apos ; m so proud of you . & quot ;
and i have to say , there was strength .
it touched something deeply deep inside me , identity , the ability of every individual to contribute to a community to a hope point of hope .
well , i went to the < unk > .
as soon as the judge saw me .
did he say , & quot ; mr. < unk > , did you ask this < unk > ? & quot ;
i said , & quot ; yeah . & quot ; and then we started to discuss .
and more and more people would come in because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
< unk > came in and < unk > < unk > and < unk > .
in the u.k. , there was a full of people who were angry , that we were talking about skin color , poverty , of inequality .
from my graduate student , i looked up and down the janitors .
he would see over and over again through the window , and he could hear all that waste stuff .
he went up and down .
finally , this older man , < unk > , < unk > < unk > in the < unk > , sat behind me , almost to the < unk > .
10 minutes later , the judge quit a pause .
during the pause , a < unk > would come in and cut it away , the janitors were in the house .
this one ran across the head of the older black .
he said , & quot ; jimmy , what are you doing in the jump ? & quot ;
the older man stood up . he looked at the head of the man , and then he looked at me , and he said , & quot ; i & apos ; m here to tell this young man , don & apos ; t lose the goal out of the eye . don & apos ; t you < unk > . & quot ;
i & apos ; ve come to ted because i think many of you have found that the moral happiness of the universe works far , but it & apos ; s the justice of the universe .
that we , as humans , are not completely evolved as long as we don & apos ; t take care of human rights and human rights .
that our whole survival is connected to survival every single one .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and creation , entertainment and creativity , with humanity , for compassion and justice .
and most of all , i would like to share with you who see this as well , simply , lose : don & apos ; t lose the target out of your mind . don & apos ; t give up .
they have seen , in this audience , seen a obvious desire and it belongs to them and to do something .
what else can we do ?
< unk > < unk > : well , we have opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there & apos ; s a < unk > spring in this spring , where it & apos ; s actually about making an effort to do something that < unk > < unk > that otherwise flows into the politics of punishment .
here , for example , in california , one billion next five years will be a billion dollars for death row a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all < unk > doesn & apos ; t end with a < unk > .
56 percent of all the < unk > kids do not come to court .
here we have the chance to do something .
this emerging field is going to propose that it & apos ; s going to invest in more money and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the breast cancer epidemic in america has been immense .
this issue is often asked in a context that is increased .
what would you say to someone who believes this ?
well , in fact , the number of < unk > don & apos ; t change that much .
most of the school students in this country did not really find in grade education .
it was the < unk > < unk > against drugs .
and that & apos ; s why we get the dramatic numbers at the prisoners .
we & apos ; ve become < unk > by the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have & quot ; < unk > & quot ; -- that people get behind bars for always a < unk > , for a < unk > , good job , instead of putting it on the victims , giving things back .
i think we need to be doing more to help people , the victims of a < unk > , not less .
and i don & apos ; t think our current sent to anyone .
i think that & apos ; s what we need to change .
you know , < unk > , they really did get a string on it .
they & apos ; re an inspiring personality .
thank you for coming to ted . thank you .
bin laden & apos ; s seen a great deal of < unk > deaths .
& quot ; famine in somalia . three , o.c of police . & quot ;
4 speakers , if you will , will , < unk > < unk > .
six of them would be social . seven , dead 65 years old .
eight speakers , < unk > speakers nine .
different speakers , < unk > . nuclear weapons .
recession . recession . < unk > . egypt .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips i & apos ; ve collected over the last six months -- but have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media prefer to show us negative issues because our mind gets your attention exactly on these issues .
and there is a very good reason for that .
every second , our senses , every second , will begin to process much more information than our brain ever process .
and because we don & apos ; t care about anything more than our survival , the first stop visual information is a part of our lives , the lead .
so the fun of the early warning systems is our < unk > .
it & apos ; s < unk > and < unk > all the information on the quest for whether it & apos ; s in our neighborhood .
so if we & apos ; re watching the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , & quot ; if it & apos ; s < unk > , the demand & quot ; is very true .
now , with all our digital devices , we have seven days a week , 24 hours a day , all of these negative messages is not a miracle we are pessimistic .
it & apos ; s not a miracle that everybody thinks the world is always going worse .
but possibly not be the case .
maybe that & apos ; s the reality .
perhaps the tremendous progress that we & apos ; ve made in the last century is a series of forces , which is so strong that it will allow us to create a world of abundance in the next three decades .
now , i & apos ; m not saying that we don & apos ; t have big problems -- climate crisis , climate change , < unk > and < unk > -- we & apos ; ve got them before .
and as humans , we & apos ; re much better at < unk > problems in a very long way , but ultimately spreading them out .
let & apos ; s see what we & apos ; ve come up with in the last century so that we can < unk > the development .
in the last 100 years , average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled to inflation , inflation has < unk > the world & apos ; s population has < unk > .
child mortality is reduced by a tenth of child mortality .
but it & apos ; s < unk > , < unk > < unk > and < unk > < unk > have reduced .
steve anybody showed us that we & apos ; re in a very peaceful era right now , in a very peaceful life .
and according to charles < unk > , the average rate in the last 130 years has gone up to 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget this .
and we & apos ; re increasing our expectations all the time .
in fact , we have defined poverty .
consider that a great deal of americans who live below the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , pick up tv , mobile phones , < unk > and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the < unk > of the earth , could never have < unk > such a < unk > .
the basis of a lot of these technologies , and they grow < unk > .
so my good friend of ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that & apos ; s then doubled to information technology , on the graph of moore & apos ; s law of moore & apos ; s law , and each 12 to 24 months & apos ; s doubled .
so the mobile phone in your pocket costs about a million times less , and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the & apos ; 70s .
now look at this curve .
that & apos ; s moore & apos ; s law over the last hundred years .
notice two things about this curve .
first , how may it be -- it & apos ; s in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and < unk > .
that & apos ; s the result of faster computers building < unk > computers .
it doesn & apos ; t slowed down for any of our big problems .
furthermore , despite her logarithmic < unk > on the left side , she & apos ; s up .
so the rate of growth is accelerating .
and on this curve , on top of moore & apos ; s law , we find an extraordinary array of technologies that are all available .
& quot ; < unk > , & quot ; something my friends at if it & apos ; s < unk > , & quot ; sensors , sensors , robots , 3d printers that allow us to < unk > the personal production on our planet , synthetic < unk > , biology , < unk > , < unk > , < unk > ...
how many of you have seen the victory of < unk > supercomputer in & quot ; risk & quot ; ?
that was a < unk > .
i used to look for newspapers and look for the best headlines i could find .
i love these , & quot ; watson & apos ; s human enemies . & quot ;
& quot ; risk & quot ; is not a simple game .
it & apos ; s about understanding the language of language .
imagine there & apos ; s this artificial intelligence to each other & apos ; s owner in the morning .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i , at ted , launched a new university called structure < unk > .
we teach our students to all these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask to make the students , the products , the services , the services , the right answer , to a decade , to the life of the people .
think about how a group of students now can shape the life of billions of people .
30 years ago , that would have been < unk > .
today , we can gone onto dozens of companies that were being able to do just that .
if i think that creating abundance , then i don & apos ; t mean a life of luxury for anyone on this planet , it & apos ; s about me to create a life of possibilities .
it & apos ; s about setting up goods for real time .
television is actually < unk > , and technology is a < unk > force .
here & apos ; s an example .
this is the story of < unk > < unk > in the middle of the 18th century .
he & apos ; s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of < unk > to dinner .
< unk > soldiers got < unk > , < unk > soldiers got < unk > .
however , the king of < unk > was born .
aluminum was at that time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and didn & apos ; t .
here & apos ; s why the dome dome dome of the civil war is made out of aluminum .
even though aluminum < unk > percent of the population & apos ; s population , it doesn & apos ; t appear as a full metal .
it & apos ; s connected by oxygen and < unk > .
but then , technology of < unk > was developed and made < unk > so cheap that we use it in our dollars .
and then , let & apos ; s put this analogy into the future .
we & apos ; re thinking today in mass protection .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that is filled with more energy than we consume every year .
< unk > energy < unk > all the equipment on the earth & apos ; s surface .
it & apos ; s not a world & apos ; s fight , it & apos ; s a problem .
and there & apos ; s good news .
this year , for the first time , you & apos ; ve been able to get the cost of solar power in india to reduce 50 percent of the value , < unk > rupees in comparison to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar , last year , by 50 percent .
and this has been published last month to show that , until finally , this decade at the end of this decade in the u.s. areas of solar energy per < unk > , compared to 15 cents in the national cost of national average .
and if we have a design process , then we & apos ; ll also have water abundance .
let & apos ; s talk about < unk > .
do you remember carl sagan , 1990 , when it was < unk > to saturn , back towards earth ?
he took a very famous photograph . what was it called ?
& quot ; a & apos ; s blue now . & quot ;
because we live on a < unk > life .
we live on a planet that is covered in 70 percent of the water .
yes , there are < unk > percent of seawater , two percent are < unk > , and we & apos ; re fighting two percent of the water on the planet , but there & apos ; s also hope here .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it & apos ; s a new < unk > on the road , < unk > .
and from a conversation this morning with dean < unk > , one of the innovators in the innovators , i would like to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- which is called & quot ; < unk > & quot ; -- perhaps a lot of you have .
there can be thousands of clean drinking water a day from various sources -- whether it & apos ; s seawater , domestic water -- water -- and all this stuff for less than two cents a mile .
the director of coca-cola has just been < unk > , a big , to start with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything & apos ; s going to be fine , and i & apos ; m very confident , coca-cola will apply this technology global to global countries around the planet .
this is incremental innovation that exists today .
and we & apos ; ve seen it at mobile phones .
you mean my goodness , we & apos ; re going to reach the 70 percent < unk > of mobile phones in developing countries by the end of september .
just consider that a < unk > cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better < unk > than president or 25 years ago .
and if you & apos ; re looking at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton , 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communications , which nobody ever allowed to predict .
and it gets even better , the things that they spent , and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , < unk > and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology to medical doctors -- and now , literally , become cheaper and cheaper in their cell phone .
and the best part of that is possibly , what & apos ; s expected in health .
i & apos ; ve had the pleasure last month , the < unk > < unk > of what & apos ; s called & quot ; 10 million < unk > < unk > x prize . & quot ;
we ask teams around the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone , so that you can talk to the device , because it & apos ; s equipped with ai , you can put together < unk > or test < unk > .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of < unk > physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the healthcare workers and 1.3 percent of employees & apos ; s health care .
if this device is a < unk > or < unk > , who & apos ; s not familiar , it & apos ; s going to get a 100 percent others and prevent a pandemic from your outbreak .
but now , the biggest force that & apos ; s going to lead us to a world of interested .
i call them & quot ; the coming billion . & quot ;
the white lines are for population .
we & apos ; ve just passed the < unk > .
and just by the way , the biggest < unk > against an population is a better education and food in the whole world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we go up from two to five billion < unk > .
three billion new heads that we & apos ; ve never heard of before become the world & apos ; s own communication .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of species of economic growth , i see one of the great economic projects in history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are going to go into the global economy .
and they & apos ; ll be getting healthier , and they & apos ; ll be trained by < unk > , and by doing so they & apos ; ll be the opportunity to have 3d 3d 3d printers and & quot ; < unk > & quot ; -- and so much more productive than ever .
so what can be three billion growing , healthy , educated members of the world & apos ; s < unk > get us ?
what about a set of new york , < unk > voices before .
so , how about the oppressed , where are they , to make a voice , to make change and to make change , for the first time ?
what are those three billion people going to bring in ?
how about counting every time we can & apos ; t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned by the x prize is that small teams that were motivated by passion and focus can make extraordinary things that big companies and governments could only create in the past .
i want to close with a story that really got excited about me .
there & apos ; s a program that some might know .
it & apos ; s a game called < unk > .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and it & apos ; s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
the more we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the design world .
so far , that & apos ; s been a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people now playing the game online .
and it turns out that today the human pattern recognition is better < unk > the proteins than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who is the best < unk > in the world wasn & apos ; t a < unk > , it wasn & apos ; t a < unk > , it was somebody from england , like a woman who worked as an assistant to the world at night and the best .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous faith in our future is the fact that we now have more power than individuals to face us to the huge challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we & apos ; ve got a passion for a war child .
we & apos ; ve got the capital of < unk > .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work on online to master the new challenges , and in order to do that , what you need to do .
so we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something against an < unk > piece of medical culture that we need to do .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that & apos ; s me .
and perhaps i have been in the business for a long time when i & apos ; m able to give myself a piece of my own wrong < unk > to make this happen .
but before i get to the end of my talk , let & apos ; s start baseball with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we & apos ; re near our energy systems and we & apos ; re moving towards the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
& quot ; < unk > & quot ; appears very soon and turns out to be about statistics , and to use it to make a great baseball team .
i & apos ; m going to refer to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard before .
it & apos ; s the < unk > of the < unk > .
we & apos ; re talking about 300 , if a bat is 300 people .
this means the player safe three of 10 beats .
this is called the ball to the < unk > , and it & apos ; s not being caught , and who & apos ; s trying to shoot the ball to the first base . doesn & apos ; t make it in time and the physical was security .
three out of 10 .
you know what you call a < unk > in < unk > baseball model ?
good , really good , maybe a < unk > .
you know what they call an < unk > ?
that & apos ; s somebody that & apos ; s safe in the rest of your head .
< unk > -- like ted williams < unk > -- the last < unk > < unk > player who met < unk > during a < unk > season in 400 times .
so let & apos ; s go back to my medical world where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely to come to talk to you about this .
suppose you have a < unk > , and you & apos ; re < unk > to a < unk > of its < unk > 400 in terms of its < unk > .
somehow it doesn & apos ; t work , right ?
imagine if you live in a certain area , and you have a beloved human being with < unk > < unk > , and you & apos ; re < unk > to a < unk > area whose number of people on < unk > to 200 .
but you know what ?
it & apos ; s much better this year . it & apos ; s on top of a branch .
and she & apos ; s beating a < unk > .
somehow it doesn & apos ; t work .
but i & apos ; m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the < unk > might be for a < unk > or a nurse or a < unk > , a < unk > , an < unk > ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody knows in all the medical science of what a good surgeon or doctor should be .
what we & apos ; re doing though is we were each of them , including me , embedded in the world with being perfect .
never make a mistake , but nobody is really going to worry about the details of how that should get done .
and that & apos ; s the news i put in the < unk > valley .
i was a < unk > student .
in high school , a < unk > said that brian < unk > would learn for a learning curve .
and it did .
and i learned , in my small community , in the sisters in the toronto , < unk > at toronto , < unk > from here .
i learned everything memorized .
in my < unk > , i learned the origins and < unk > every branch of a branch of a single artery from which it is < unk > , < unk > and ordinary < unk > .
i even knew the < unk > to classify < unk > < unk > .
and over time , i & apos ; ve collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed with < unk > < unk > .
and i left the point that i knew if i knew everything , and all that , or at least as much as i could , as close to < unk > as possible that i would ever be immune versus errors .
and it was working for a while when i met a woman printer .
i was brought to a < unk > table in toronto as a woman printer to me in the < unk > of the hospital .
and that was when i was a fellow at the < unk > layer in the < unk > service program .
and it was my mission to look at that < unk > piece of advice , or < unk > advice .
and there & apos ; s feedback to my < unk > .
i studied a woman printer , and she was in < unk > .
and when i was listening to her , she made noise < unk > .
and when i was < unk > your chest with the < unk > < unk > , i could hear an < unk > sound on both sides that told me that they were suffering under < unk > heart disease .
this is a state that fails to pump the whole blood , it turns out to be a part of the blood in the lung , and it < unk > those , so gradually the < unk > .
and that wasn & apos ; t a difficult way to deal with .
and i hired them and went to the treatment .
i gave her < unk > . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine we call < unk > , water every night , so that she < unk > liquid .
and over a period of time and a half to two hours , she started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and then i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my < unk > .
i didn & apos ; t take up and do what i should have had , which would have been a phone call on my < unk > to get it out with him , so that he had a chance of making a different picture .
and he knew what he would have been able to get additional information into it .
maybe i did a good reason .
maybe i didn & apos ; t want to be a medical doctor .
maybe i was going to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would be so , and so i would be able to care for my patients without him .
my second mistake was worse .
so that & apos ; s what i sent back home , and i put a little bit quiet in my voice that tried to tell me , & quot ; don & apos ; t do any good idea . don & apos ; t do that . & quot ;
in fact , i didn & apos ; t really think of it so much that i asked the nurse who was taking care of this woman , & quot ; do you think it & apos ; s okay when you & apos ; re home ? & quot ;
and the nurse thought about it and said in a more traditional way , & quot ; yeah , i think it & apos ; s going to be good . & quot ;
i remember that as if it was yesterday .
so i took off the < unk > , and an listen to the < unk > , and they took them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had that < unk > feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , i got the hospital , and i went to the parking lot to get home with the car when i did something that i didn & apos ; t otherwise .
i went away from my own way home .
and there she said another nurse , not the sister who had seen a woman printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most of the < unk > that i & apos ; ve ever met .
other doctors also feel these same , but the < unk > is very special because we see the patients just like this .
the three words , remember , remember ?
& quot ; do you remember the patient who you were going to go home ? & quot ;
asked the nurse & apos ; s nurse .
& quot ; so she & apos ; s back , & quot ; she said in this particular < unk > .
so she was back .
she was back and killed .
and about an hour after she got home , after i got them sent them home , they took off , and the family < unk > < unk > , and they took them back to the < unk > blood cell blood cell blood cell blood cell blood cell , that & apos ; s a < unk > cell .
she wasn & apos ; t in front of you , and she was blue .
the nice thing is , all the strands went away .
they gave their < unk > .
they closed them to the < unk > .
i was shocked and < unk > to the inside .
and i was living these rollercoaster because they came out of the research area and i hoped that she was going to recover .
and after two days three days , they realized she was never going to go back .
it didn & apos ; t have a < unk > < unk > through it .
her family got together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they & apos ; re actually < unk > to the system .
on day four , they day they < unk > them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
they & apos ; re saying that the names of people who don & apos ; t forget < unk > .
and this was the first time that i learned this myself .
the next couple of weeks i was training , and for the first time , the unhealthy shame exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you & apos ; re having , because you can & apos ; t talk to colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend , even though that & apos ; s on < unk > and you get caught and the best friend with it , and you get a terrible debate when you leave it with a bad error and you win it .
if you do something together and don & apos ; t make the mistake again .
this is the kind of < unk > shame .
the kind of unhealthy species that i & apos ; m talking about is the one that makes you sick .
it & apos ; s the one that & apos ; s telling you , not what you did badly , but that you & apos ; re bad at you .
and that & apos ; s what i felt .
and it wasn & apos ; t due to my < unk > , it was very dear .
he was talking to the family , and i & apos ; m sure he took up the street and made sure i wasn & apos ; t not going to get into trouble .
but i was < unk > these questions .
why didn & apos ; t i ask the question ? why do i put them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how was i able to make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly , though , it took a second .
i started feeling better .
and then on a day of a hole , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun came out , and i might say , & quot ; i might feel better again . & quot ;
and i came back with myself that if i could < unk > my efforts of perfection and never < unk > a mistake that might < unk > the voice .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i did a service in the < unk > hospital in a < unk > north of toronto , and i did a < unk > man with < unk > < unk > .
it really was coming , and i & apos ; m in a hurry .
he & apos ; s always shown there .
i looked in the < unk > , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and i fort .
and yet , while he came out of the door , he showed his < unk > .
two days later , i came to my next < unk > and my book club asked me to go into a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words , you remember ?
& quot ; do you remember the patient with the patients ? & quot ;
it turned out to be a < unk > .
he had a potentially < unk > disease called < unk > .
you can google < unk > , but it & apos ; s not an infection of < unk > , it & apos ; s < unk > of < unk > .
and fortunately , he didn & apos ; t die .
he got < unk > < unk > and recovered a few days later .
and i went through the same < unk > of shame and do , feeling free me and went through the work until it came again and again and again .
in a mass of four , i & apos ; ve missed an < unk > 20 times .
there & apos ; s quite a few things already , especially if you think that you & apos ; re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients at that time .
in both cases , i wasn & apos ; t sending them home , and there were no such thing as being a took place in their treatment .
on one occasion , i thought he was < unk > .
i < unk > the kidneys of the kidneys . when this was < unk > , my colleague at < unk > & apos ; s university was a < unk > < unk > in the bottom right seat , and i called the < unk > .
the other one had powerful diarrhea .
i < unk > < unk > to < unk > him , and i asked my colleagues to do it too .
and that & apos ; s what he did , and he then took a < unk > in the bottom seat , and he signed up the < unk > .
in both cases , they lost , and they were doing fine .
both of these cases < unk > me , < unk > me .
and i & apos ; d be happy to say that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues claim , but total nonsense .
i think some of my favorite features happened in the last five years .
alone , shame and without support .
here & apos ; s the problem : if i can & apos ; t get along with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can talk to the quiet voice that really tells me , what can & apos ; t happen , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so they don & apos ; t do the same ?
if i & apos ; m in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you & apos ; re thinking about me .
when did you hear the last time ever heard of somebody talking about < unk > < unk > ?
oh yeah , they come to a cocktail party , and there you may hear about any other doctor , but you & apos ; re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistake .
if i were to stand in a room full of colleagues and ask their immediate support and start telling them what i just told you , i probably wouldn & apos ; t touch the end of the second story before it really changed you , somebody & apos ; s going to change the joke and make a joke .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that an < unk > in my hospital had lost the wrong leg , then i & apos ; d be able to see him in the eyes .
that is the system that we live in .
it & apos ; s totally < unk > .
it & apos ; s a system where there are two fundamental places -- those that make the mistakes and the ones that don & apos ; t . those who study < unk > and < unk > without limitation , with bad results and results .
it & apos ; s almost a ideological reaction like antibodies that attack people on it .
and there & apos ; s this idea that when we make those that make mistakes out of medicine , we have a safety system .
but there are two problems with this .
in my age , about 20 years of medicine and journalism , i & apos ; ve built a personal medical study on medical errors and wrong treatments to be able to learn anything like that for my first article that i & apos ; m doing for the star of toronto , & quot ; serious art , black art , black . & quot ;
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely < unk > .
we & apos ; re working in a system where every single day , in which one out of 10 < unk > is either a wrong or wrong , in which the < unk > and < unk > are always going to happen , or < unk > .
in this state there & apos ; s about around very apos ; ve been around 24,000 < unk > errors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine put 100,000 .
they & apos ; re both quite sophisticated , because we don & apos ; t really think about the problem the same as we should .
and that & apos ; s the < unk > .
in a field of science that the medical knowledge is doubling every two to three years , we can not keep up with that .
< unk > is ubiquitous .
we can & apos ; t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error so that we can take a perfect test for a patient with chest pain .
and then i take the same patient with < unk > , and i < unk > it and < unk > it and i give it a little < unk > breath to that and suddenly the story is < unk > with contempt .
i & apos ; m not taking the same course .
i & apos ; m not a robot ; i & apos ; m not always doing things .
and my patients are not cars ; they & apos ; re not always telling me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these things are inevitable .
so if you take the system as i & apos ; ve been taught it , and you & apos ; re all < unk > < unk > , then at the end , there & apos ; s no further left .
and do you know about people who don & apos ; t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and in my show , & quot ; white , black way . & quot ; i have the habit to say , & quot ; this is my worst mistake , & quot ; i & apos ; m going to < unk > to each of the < unk > , & quot ; why & apos ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; some & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; & quot ; < unk > & quot ; < unk > & quot ; < unk > , & quot ; & quot ; < unk > & quot ; & quot ; & quot ;
and then they expand their < unk > , they came to a head , and they & apos ; re kind of heavy , and they & apos ; re kind of hard to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , & quot ; look , don & apos ; t make the same errors i make . & quot ;
what you need is an environment that will get you in the position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physician .
the < unk > doctor is a human being who knows , in order to make his humanity , she & apos ; s not proud to make mistakes , but he puts everything out of you to learn , so that it can be passed on .
it & apos ; s shared with other experiences .
they support when others talk about their mistakes .
and it shows others their mistakes , not for < unk > , but in one art culture , it & apos ; s something that everybody & apos ; s benefit .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and if that & apos ; s the way , then people make mistakes of time too .
it & apos ; s the system that & apos ; s designed to make < unk > errors that make it simple mistake to people and it & apos ; s also allowed to create caring spaces that anyone who sees health care , that can actually show new health care , and the kind of potential .
my name is brian < unk > .
i was a < unk > doctor .
i & apos ; m a human being . i make errors .
i & apos ; m a < unk > < unk > but i & apos ; m trying to learn best from this to give others to pass on .
i don & apos ; t know what they love me , but i can live with it .
let me wrap up with three of my own words : i remember .
i & apos ; m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it & apos ; s about < unk > < unk > .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i & apos ; m going to tell you three stories before that to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know he was here .
you might think he & apos ; d come back down , but that & apos ; s not true .
he collected fish , actually .
he described one of them as very & quot ; typical . & quot ;
it was a < unk > .
until the & apos ; 80s , it & apos ; s made a big style .
now he & apos ; s standing on the red list today .
this is a story that we & apos ; ve heard a lot of times from the galapagos or other places ; it & apos ; s not very special .
still , we & apos ; re still coming to the galapagos .
we still think these are originally .
the < unk > are calling them still as opposed to each other .
what & apos ; s happened here ?
the second story is going to show another concept that < unk > < unk > .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 having studied in < unk > .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a terrible < unk > , and i really didn & apos ; t believe that .
it was my first day of work .
as you can see , the cover was surrounded by < unk > and a few of them .
there were about 20 inches of power , < unk > , < unk > < unk > of < unk > .
and the < unk > of those < unk > were very < unk > , and the fishermen lived well , and they were doing well in ghana .
when i got there later , the fish moved to the half of its size .
what they did was they measured by five centimeters .
they had been genetically < unk > .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
so nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story about my favorite form at the introduction of < unk > in southeast asia .
in the & apos ; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the & apos ; 60s -- < unk > europe has many < unk > < unk > .
< unk > meant < unk > countries that were already starting to use for 100 fish , a pretty ugly ship called < unk > 4 .
i went on this , and we did all the southern hemisphere of the ocean , and especially in the < unk > sea .
we had no words for what we started .
i know now that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our lives were bigger , other animals , who are connected to the bottom .
most of the fish , the small dots there , on the fish , the fish companies , were < unk > .
essentially , the cause of the sea got on deck and then got back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is going fast .
within one year , you & apos ; ve got a survey , and you start to have the commercial fishing .
it & apos ; s going to change . -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will be < unk > .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren & apos ; t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
we started a living room .
she wasn & apos ; t yet < unk > .
they then wanted to kill them because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of < unk > , every time you & apos ; ve been building fishermen , if you & apos ; re in areas where things & # 91 ; have & # 93 ; ever been put together .
it & apos ; s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don & apos ; t remember it .
we adjust our < unk > to the new level , and we don & apos ; t remember what was going on there .
if you put it in , this is what happens .
on the y-axis is a few good things : biodiversity , number of < unk > , the green of their country , the < unk > .
over time , it & apos ; s changing . it & apos ; s changing because , for people , their actions are completely natural .
every generation is looking at the images that are going to capture them at the very beginning of their conscious life , as standard and it & apos ; s going to enable everything to happen .
the difference is what & apos ; s perceived to be a loss .
but they don & apos ; t notice the previous losses .
there can be an order of changes .
and in the end , you just want to get the remains of remains .
that is now largely our goal .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are no longer like them .
you might think now that the problem of people who were certainly , when they were living in < unk > societies , people were only killed , after a few generations , what they had done .
because obviously there & apos ; s an animal that was very common just before it came down .
so you & apos ; re not often losing animals .
you lose rare animals .
and that & apos ; s why it & apos ; s not seen as a great loss .
over time , we focus on the large animals and in the oceans , these are the big fish .
they get fewer because we & apos ; re going to catch them .
there & apos ; s very little fish left with it , and we think that & apos ; s the end effect .
the question is , why is it that people accept this ?
well , because she didn & apos ; t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , confirm that it was very different .
you will . because the evidence that you make in a earlier form is not like the evidence you & apos ; d like to argue .
for example , there & apos ; s the fact that the report of a < unk > place that & apos ; s in this area great < unk > can & apos ; t be used , or < unk > usually doesn & apos ; t get < unk > because it & apos ; s not scientific .
so we have the situation that people don & apos ; t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don & apos ; t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the tremendous role that a marine reserve can play .
because we & apos ; re essentially < unk > the past .
we & apos ; re putting back the past , which people can & apos ; t understand because the changes that have changed and are very low .
and so the people who see a marine reserve and benefit from the insight into that allow it to < unk > their < unk > .
what about the people who are not possible , because they have no access to -- for example , in the middle of the west ?
there , i think the art and the film may fill in the gap and the simulation as well as simulation .
that & apos ; s the simulation bay .
long ago , there was < unk > -- 500 years ago .
and the < unk > and < unk > may remind you of & quot ; avatar . & quot ;
if you think about & quot ; avatar , & quot ; when you think about why people have been touched like this -- apart from the < unk > , why were you so touched by the number of people ?
because it & apos ; s gone through something that has lost in a certain way .
so my idea is that the only one i & apos ; m going to give is going to cameron itself to get < unk > < unk > .
thank you .
in the & apos ; 80s , in the communist < unk > , you had to , if you had a typewriter , they would be organized by the government .
they also had to create a sheet of plastic bags from this typewriter .
the reason for that was the government could rise , where a text came from .
they found a paper called < unk > < unk > , and they could track the < unk > of those thoughts .
and we couldn & apos ; t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how much < unk > free speech would be .
in our own countries , we & apos ; d never do that .
but if you & apos ; re buying a new year in 2011 today , from the leading < unk > , and print a page , then this side of light that & apos ; s very complicated , on every side , in a pattern that makes the page clearly , on your printer .
this is happening today .
and nobody seems to agree with that .
and that was an example of how our own governments use the technology against us , the citizens .
and that & apos ; s one of the three main characteristics of the existing world today .
let & apos ; s see what & apos ; s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three main approaches .
there are < unk > .
for example , this is mr. this is < unk > < unk > from leave , leave it back in leave .
and the anything that was going on really easy about < unk > .
these people make money .
they use < unk > to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several familiar cases of < unk > , < unk > that made their money using attacks .
this is < unk > < unk > from < unk > , estonia .
this is alfred < unk > .
stephen watts .
< unk > < unk > .
these are matthew anderson , < unk > < unk > and so on and so on .
now these people have come online , but they & apos ; ve taken it away from , like they & apos ; ve deployed money from our bank accounts , while we & apos ; re doing our < unk > , or < unk > , which is where we & apos ; ve collected our < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > light on a computer .
the u.s. intelligence agency launched two months ago , the swiss & apos ; s swiss state here , and that back there , was < unk > million dollars when it got frozen .
mr. for itself is back foot , the < unk > is unknown .
and i & apos ; m saying that today we & apos ; re more likely to be a victim of a kind , rather than a crime in the real world .
and it & apos ; s very obvious that this gets worse .
in the future , most crime are < unk > online .
the second largest recorded we see today aren & apos ; t driven by money .
they & apos ; re motivated by something else -- like billion people , or by their audience .
anonymous groups like anonymous have come over the last 12 months , and they & apos ; ve become one of the most popular companies in the field of < unk > .
so these are the three < unk > : criminals who are struggling to make it for money , including anonymous , but who are the last group of nations , governments who run attacks .
there are cases that we & apos ; re going on , like < unk > < unk > .
it shows you what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
< unk > is a < unk > in the netherlands -- or was that .
in the last fall , it had to wake up < unk > , because < unk > was hacked .
you know , someone came out , and they hacked the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch < unk > , i asked one of the senior members of that group to see if he made it possible for the fact that because of the < unk > people had died .
and his answer was & quot ; yes . & quot ;
now , how do people die in a result of such cheap ?
< unk > is a writing system .
they & apos ; re selling < unk > .
what are you doing with < unk > ?
now , a certificate , you need a website called < unk > , with a < unk > service , for example , < unk > .
now we & apos ; re all using , or many of us , two of them , or one of their competitors , but these services , especially in < unk > places like iran , where foreign men like < unk > are , because they don & apos ; t know more trust people than local government < unk > .
but if you can go to a foreign bit .
< unk > < unk > and < unk > < unk > .
and that & apos ; s exactly what happens in case of happens .
now , what about the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt , for example ?
now , in egypt , in april of 2011 , the back of the egyptian < unk > , and in that way , they found a lot of records .
in this records there was a folder called & quot ; < unk > . & quot ;
and in this folder , < unk > itself in germany , the egyptian government sold a few programs that they had -- in very large scale -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for < unk > dollars to the egyptian government .
the < unk > is right there .
so western governments provide governments with < unk > < unk > so that people can work against their own citizens .
but western governments are helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , the so-called < unk > , and this was a < unk > used by german < unk > to < unk > their own citizens .
if you & apos ; re in a travel industry , then you & apos ; re very likely to < unk > your phone .
but today we & apos ; re way beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
they use them , like the < unk > , to < unk > their computer with a < unk > device that allows them to monitor all their communication , their < unk > , their < unk > , their < unk > .
so if we continue thinking about things like that , then the obvious answer to people is , & quot ; ok , that sounds bad , but it & apos ; s not in my mind because i & apos ; m a < unk > citizen .
i don & apos ; t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . & quot ;
and this argument doesn & apos ; t make any sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not about debate .
it & apos ; s not a matter of privacy and safety .
it is a choice between freedom and control .
and while we & apos ; re today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , it & apos ; s all right to make that we & apos ; re always < unk > .
and do we trust that we are blind to every future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
those are the questions that we need to deal with over the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i & apos ; m a big fan of < unk > .
the first < unk > were made < unk > and < unk > of a simple idea : < unk > out of a set of set and measurements that fit in .
< unk > became very quick , < unk > < unk > in the world .
they kept us in a position to build things bigger than we were , bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , the building block had become a building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it was called the & quot ; automatically rock . & quot ;
and within a few years , lego had lego in every household .
it & apos ; s been estimated that over 400 billion rocks are produced -- or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
you don & apos ; t need to be an engineer to create nice houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego essentially < unk > the world & apos ; s first building , and it took a building for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year at bell , bell labs announced the next revolution , the next one .
the transistor was a small < unk > spread us from a world of < unk > tiles to a world that was all interactive .
how the < unk > , allowing us to build much larger , more complex space , a stone after the other .
but there & apos ; s one last question : the transistor was just for experts .
personally , i don & apos ; t accept the fact that the building block of our world & apos ; s building for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea about how you could put the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
some years ago , i started developing < unk > .
let me show you how they work .
< unk > are electronic pieces that have specific function .
they & apos ; re < unk > , light , clay , motor and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect to magnets .
and so you can & apos ; t get them wrong .
the stones are < unk > .
green is output , blue is current , pink input is input and orange cables .
so all they need to do is connect a blue one , and one green one another , and they can build a very fast set of < unk > .
they put a blue on one green , and they can make light .
they can make a switch in between , and they & apos ; ve created a little < unk > structure .
take the switch out the switch to take a < unk > , which is here , cut , and you make a little < unk > .
put that together for an extra effect , and you & apos ; ve produced an < unk > .
i & apos ; m going to stop that .
beyond simple game , < unk > is actually quite powerful .
instead of programming , you have to program < unk > or < unk > , let & apos ; s allow them to program simple , intuitive gestures .
so , to cut that away or slow it down , just go to the button and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
now the idea behind this is that it & apos ; s a growing library .
we want to get every single interaction in the world into a < unk > rock .
lights , sound , < unk > , motors -- should be available .
we & apos ; ve looked at kids and they & apos ; re playing with it .
and it was an unbelievable experience .
it & apos ; s the most beautiful thing about how they start to understand electronics that are in everyday life that they don & apos ; t learn in school .
like , for example , a < unk > works , or why the doors of the < unk > pattern , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we also brought < unk > to < unk > .
so , for example , we had no experience in electronic things , which began to play with < unk > as materials .
here we see with < unk > , paper and water bottles , like < unk > ...
just a couple of weeks ago , we brought < unk > to risd , and we put them on some designers who didn & apos ; t have any technical experience -- just takes wood and paper -- and told them , & quot ; what does . & quot ;
so here & apos ; s an example of a project they did , which is a < unk > project .
but wait here , it really is my < unk > here .
it & apos ; s a < unk > made from play-doh , which is fear in the dark .
this < unk > , < unk > became another material , electronics , was simply another material .
and we want to make this material available to all of us .
so open source is open source .
you can go to the website , all the < unk > and download yourself .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventors , the data person , because this world that we live in , this interactive world belongs to us .
so , pull it off , and start to invent .
thank you .
